0	A Dog with a Bad Name	Male	1886	"A DOG WITH A BAD NAME  BY TALBOT BAINES REED    CHAPTER ONE.  DRY-ROT.  Bolsover College was in a bad temper.  It often was; for as a rule it had little else to do; and what it had, was usually a less congenial occupation.  Bolsover, in fact, was a school which sadly needed two trifling reforms before it could be expected to do much good in the world.  One was, that all its masters should be dismissed; the other was, that all its boys should be expelled.  When these little changes had been effected there was every chance of turning the place into a creditable school; but not much chance otherwise.  For Bolsover College was afflicted with dry-rot.  The mischief had begun not last term or the term before.  Years ago it had begun to eat into the place, and every year it grew more incurable.  Occasional efforts had been made to patch things up.  A boy had been now and then expelled. A master had now and then ""resigned.""  An old rule had now and then been enforced.  A new rule was now and then instituted.  But you can't patch up a dry-rot, and Bolsover crumbled more and more the oftener it was touched.  Years ago it had dropped out of the race with the other public-schools. Its name had disappeared from the pass list of the University and Civil Service candidates.  Scarcely a human being knew the name of its head- master; and no assistant-master was ever known to make Bolsover a stepping-stone to pedagogic promotion.  The athletic world knew nothing of a Bolsover Eleven or Fifteen; and, worse still, no Bolsover boy was ever found who was proud either of his school or of himself.  Somebody asks, why, if the place was in such a bad way, did parents continue to send their boys there, when they had all the public-schools in England to choose from?  To that the answer is very simple.  Bolsover was cheap--horribly cheap!  ""A high class public-school education,"" to quote the words of the prospectus, ""with generous board and lodging, in a beautiful midland county, in a noble building with every modern advantage; gymnasium, cricket-field, and a full staff of professors and masters,"" for something under forty pounds a year, was a chance not to be snuffed at by an economical parent or guardian.  And when to these attractions was promised ""a strict attention to morals, and a supervision of wardrobes by an experienced matron,"" even the hearts of mothers went out towards the place.  After all, argues many an easy-going parent, a public-school education is a public-school education, whether dear Benjamin gets it at Eton, or Shrewsbury, or Bolsover.  We cannot afford Eton or Shrewsbury, but we will make a pinch and send him to Bolsover, which sounds almost as good and may even be better.  So to Bolsover dear Benjamin goes, and becomes a public-school boy.  In that ""noble building"" he does pretty much as he likes, and eats very much what he can.  The ""full staff of professors and masters"" interfere very little with his liberty, and the ""attention to morals"" is never inconveniently obtruded.  He goes home pale for the holidays and comes back paler each term.  He scuffles about now and then in the play-ground and calls it athletics.  He gets up Caesar with a crib and Todhunter with a key, and calls it classics and mathematics.  He loafs about with a toady and calls it friendship.  In short, he catches the Bolsover dry- rot, and calls it a public-school training:  What is it makes Benjamin and his seventy-nine school-fellows (for Bolsover had its full number of eighty boys this term) in such a particularly ill-humour this grey October morning?  Have his professors and masters gently hinted to him that he is expected to know his lessons next time he goes into class?  Or has the experienced matron been overdoing her attention to his morals?  Ask him.  ""What!"" he says, ""don't you know what the row is?  It's enough to make anybody shirty. Frampton, this new head-master, you know, he's only been here a week or two, he's going to upset everything.  I wish to goodness old Mullany had stuck on, cad as he was.  He let us alone, but this beast Frampton's smashing the place up.  What do you think?--you'd never guess, he's made a rule the fellows are all to tub every morning, whether they like it or not.  What do you call that?  I know I'll get my governor to make a row about it.  It won't wash, I can tell you.  What business has he to make us tub, eh, do you hear?  That's only one thing.  He came and jawed us in the big room this morning, and said he meant to make football compulsory!  There!  You needn't gape as if you thought I was gammoning. I'm not, I mean it.  Football's to be compulsory.  Every man Jack's got to play, whether he can or not.  I call it brutal!  The only thing is, it won't be done.  The fellows will kick.  I shall.  I'm not going to play football to please a cad like Frampton, or any other cad!""  What Benjamin says is, for a wonder, the truth.  A curious change had come over Bolsover since the end of last term.  Old Mr Mullany, good old fossil that he was, had resigned.  The boys had heard casually of the event at the end of last term.  But the old gentleman so seldom appeared in their midst, and when he did, so rarely made any show of authority, that the school had grown to look upon him as an inoffensive old fogey, whose movements made very little difference to anybody.  It was not till the holidays were over, and Mr Frampton introduced himself as the new head-master, that Bolsover awoke to the knowledge that a change had taken place.  Mr Frampton--he was not even a ""Doctor"" or a ""Reverend,"" but was a young man with sandy whiskers, and a red tie--had a few ideas of his own on the subject of dry-rot.  He evidently preferred ripping up entire floors to patching single planks, and he positively scared his colleagues and pupils by the way he set to work. He was young and enthusiastic, and was perhaps tempted to overdo things at first.  When people are being reformed, they need a little breathing time now and then; but Mr Frampton seemed to forget it.  He had barely been in his post a week when two of the under-masters resigned their posts.  Undaunted he brought over two new men, who shared his own ideas, and installed them into the vacancies.  Then three more of the old masters resigned; and three more new men took their places. Then the ""experienced matron"" resigned, and Mrs Frampton took her place.  No sooner was that done than the order went out that every boy should have a cold bath every morning, unless excused by the doctor. The school couldn't resign, so they sulked, and gasped in the unwelcome element, and coughed heart-rendingly whenever they met the tyrant.  The tyrant was insatiate.  Before the school could recover from his first shock, the decree for compulsory football staggered it.  Compulsory football!  Why, half the fellows in the school had never put their toes to a football in their lives, and those who had had rarely done more than punt the leather aimlessly about, when they felt in the humour to kick something, and nobody or nothing more convenient was at hand.  But it was useless to represent this to Mr Frampton.  ""The sooner you begin to play the better,"" was his reply to all such objections.  But the old goal posts were broken, and the ball was flabby and nearly worn-out.  ""The new goals and ball are to arrive from London to-day.""  But they had not got flannels or proper clothes to play in.  ""They must get flannels.  Every boy must have flannels, and meanwhile they must wear the oldest shirts and trousers they had.""  Shirts and trousers!  Then they weren't even to be allowed to wear coats and waistcoats this chilly weather!  Hadn't they better wait till next week, till they could ask leave of their parents, and get their flannels and practise a bit?  ""No.  Between now and Saturday they would have two clear days to practise.  On Saturday, the Sixth would play the School at three o'clock.""  And Mr Frampton, there being nothing more to say on this subject, went off to see what his next pleasant little surprise should be.  Bolsover, meanwhile, snarled over the matter in ill-tempered conclaves in the play-ground.  ""It's simple humbug,"" said Farfield, one of the Sixth.  ""I defy him to make me play if I don't choose.""  ""I shall stand with my hands in my pockets, and not move an inch,"" said another.  ""I mean to sit down on the grass and have a nap,"" said a third.  ""All very well,"" said a youngster, called Forrester; ""if you can get all the other fellows to do the same.  But if some of them play, it'll look as if you funked it.""  ""Who cares what it looks like?"" said Farfield.  ""It will look like not being made to do what they've no right to make us do--that's all I care about.""  ""Well, I don't know,"" said Pridger, another of the Sixth; ""if it came to the School licking us, I fancy I'd try to prevent that.""  ""And if it came to the Sixth licking us,"" said young Forrester, who was of the audacious order, ""I fancy _I'd_ try to put a stopper on that.""  There was a smile at this, for the valiant junior was small for his age, and flimsily built.  Smiles, however, were not the order of the day, and for the most part Bolsover brooded over her tribulations in sulky silence.  The boys had not much in common, and even a calamity like the present failed to bring them together.  The big boys mooned about and thought of their lost liberties, of the afternoons in the tuck-shop, of the yellow- backed novels under the trees, of the loafings down town, and wondered if they should ever be happy again.  The little boys--some of them--wept secretly in corners, as they pictured themselves among the killed and wounded on the terrible football field.  And as the sharp October wind cut across the play-ground, they shuddered, great and small, at the prospect of standing there on Saturday, without coats or waistcoats, and wondered if Frampton was designedly dooming them to premature graves.  A few, a very few, of the more sensible ones, tried to knock up a little practice game and prepare themselves for the terrible ordeal.  Among these were two boys belonging to the group whose conversation the reader has already overheard.  One of them, young Forrester, has already been introduced.  Junior as he was, he was a favourite all over Bolsover, for he was about the only boy in the school who was always in good spirits, and did not seem to be infected with the universal dry-rot of the place.  He was a small, handsome boy, older indeed then he looked (for he was nearly fifteen), not particularly clever or particularly jocular.  To look at him you would have thought him delicate, but there was nothing feeble in his manner.  He looked you straight in the face with a pair of brown saucy eyes; he was ready to break his neck to oblige any one; and his pocket- money (fancy a Bolsover boy having pocket-money!) was common property. Altogether he was a phenomenon at Bolsover, and fellows took to him instinctively, as fellows often do take to one whose character and disposition are a contrast to their own.  Besides this, young Forrester was neither a prig nor a toady, and devoted himself to no one in particular, so that everybody had the benefit of his good spirits, and enjoyed his pranks impartially.  The other boy, who appeared to be about eighteen or nineteen, was of a different kind.  He, too, was a cut above the average Bolsoverian, for he was clever, and had a mind of his own.  But he acted almost entirely on antipathies.  He disliked everybody, except, perhaps, young Forrester, and he found fault with everything.  Scarfe--that was his name was a Sixth Form boy, who did the right thing because he disliked doing what everybody else did, which was usually the wrong.  He disliked his school-fellows, and therefore was not displeased with Mr Frampton's reforms; but he disliked Mr Frampton and the new masters, and therefore hoped the school would resist their authority.  As for what he himself should do, that would depend on which particular antipathy was uppermost when the time came.  Curiously enough, Bolsover by no means disliked Scarfe.  They rather respected a fellow who had ideas of his own, when they themselves had so few; and as each boy, as a rule, could sympathise with his dislike of everybody else, with one exception, he found plenty of adherents and not a few toadies.  Forrester was about the only boy he really did not dislike, because Forrester did not care twopence whether any one liked him or not, and he himself was quite fond of Scarfe.  ""What do you think the fellows will do?"" said the junior, after attempting for the sixth time to ""drop"" the ball over the goal without success.  ""Why, obey, of course,"" said Scarfe scornfully.  ""Shall you?""  ""I suppose so.""  ""Why, I thought you were going to stick out.""  ""No doubt a lot of the fellows would like it if I did.  They always like somebody else to do what they don't care to do themselves.""  ""Well, you and I'll be on different sides,"" said the youngster, making another vain attempt at the goal.  ""I'm sorry for you, my boy.""  ""So am I; I'd like to see the Sixth beaten.  But there's not much chance of it if the kicking's left to you.""  ""I tell you what,"" said Forrester, ignoring the gibe.  ""I'm curious to know what Cad Jeffreys means to do.  We're bound to have some fun if he's in it.""  ""Cad Jeffreys,"" said Scarfe, with a slight increase of scorn in his face and voice, ""will probably assist the School by playing for the Sixth.""  Forrester laughed.  ""I hear he nearly drowned himself in the bath the first day, and half scragged Shrimpton for grinning at him.  If he gets on as well at football, Frampton will have something to answer for.  Why, here he comes.""  ""Suppose you invite him to come and have a knock up with the ball,"" suggested the senior.  The figure which approached the couple was one which, familiar as it was to Bolsover, would have struck a stranger as remarkable.  A big youth, so disproportionately built as to appear almost deformed, till you noticed that his shoulders were unusually broad and his feet and hands unusually large.  Whether from indolence or infirmity it was hard to say, his gait was shambling and awkward, and the strength that lurked in his big limbs and chest seemed to unsteady him as he floundered top- heavily across the play-ground.  But his face was the most remarkable part about him.  The forehead, which overhung his small, keen eyes, was large and wrinkled.  His nose was flat, and his thick, restless lips seemed to be engaged in an endless struggle to compel a steadiness they never attained.  It was an unattractive face, with little to redeem it from being hideous.  The power in it seemed all to centre in its angry brow, and the softness in its restless mouth.  The balance was bad, and the general impression forbidding.  Jeffreys was nineteen, but looked older, for he had whiskers--an unpardonable sin in the eyes of Bolsover--and was even a little bald.  His voice was deep and loud.  A stranger would have mistaken him for an inferior master, or, judging from his shabby garments, a common gardener.  Those who knew him were in no danger of making that mistake.  No boy was more generally hated.  How he came by his name of Cad Jeffreys no one knew, except that no other name could possibly describe him.  The small boys whispered to one another that once on a time he had murdered his mother, or somebody.  The curious discovered that he was a lineal descendant of Judge Jeffreys, of hanging celebrity.  The seniors represented him as a cross between Nero and Caliban, and could not forgive him for being head classic.  The one thing fellows could appreciate in him was his temper.  A child in arms, if he knew the way, could get a rise out of Cad Jeffreys, and in these dull times that was something to be thankful for.  Forrester was perhaps the most expert of Jeffreys' enemies.  He worried the Cad not so much out of spite as because it amused him, and, like the nimble matador, he kept well out of reach of the bull all the time he was firing shots at him.  ""Hullo, Jeff!"" he called out, as the Cad approached.  ""Are you going to play in the match on Saturday?""  ""No,"" said Jeffreys.  ""You're not?  Haven't you got any old clothes to play in?""  Jeffreys' brow darkened.  He glanced down at his own shabby garments, and then at Scarfe's neat suit.  ""I've got flannels,"" he said.  ""Flannels!  Why don't you play, then?  Do you think you won't look well in flannels?  He would, wouldn't he, Scarfe?""  ""I don't see how he could look better than he does now,"" replied Scarfe, looking at the figure before him.  Then noticing the black looks on his enemy's face, he added--  ""Forrester and I were having a little practice at kicking, Jeff.  You may as well join us, whether you play in the match or not.""  ""Why, are you going to play?"" asked Jeffreys, not heeding the invitation.  ""Frampton has no right to make us do it.""  ""Why not?  He's head-master.  Besides, you can get a doctor's certificate if you like.""  ""No, I can't; I'm not ill.""  ""Then you'll have to play, of course.  Everybody will, and you'd better come and practise with us now.  Do you know how to play?""  ""Of course I do,"" said Jeffreys, ""I've played at home.""  ""All serene.  Have a shot at the goal, then.""  The Cad's experience of football at home must have been of a humble description, for his attempt at a kick now was a terrible fiasco.  He missed the ball completely, and, losing his balance at the same time, fell heavily to the ground.  ""Bravo!"" cried Forrester, ""I wish I'd learnt football at home; I couldn't do that to save my life.""  ""I slipped,"" said Jeffreys, rising slowly to his feet, and flushing crimson.  ""Did you?"" said the irreverent youth.  ""I thought it was part of the play.  Stand out of the way, though, while I take a shot.""  Before, however, Jeffreys could step aside, a neat and, for a wonder, accurate drop-kick from Forrester sent the ball violently against the side of the unwieldy senior's head, knocking off his hat and nearly precipitating him a second time to the earth.  The storm fairly burst now.  As the fleet-footed junior darted past him the other struck out wildly; but missing his blow, he seized the ball and gave a furious kick in the direction of the retreating enemy.  It was a fine drop-kick, and soared far over the head of its intended victim, straight between the goal posts, an undoubted and brilliant goal.  Forrester stopped his retreat to applaud, and Scarfe scornfully joined. ""Awfully good,"" said he; ""you certainly must play on Saturday.  We've nobody can kick like that.""  ""I meant it to hit Forrester,"" said Jeffreys, panting with his effort, and his lips nearly white with excitement.  ""Would you like another shot?"" called out the young gentleman in question.  ""You ought to be ashamed of yourself, losing your temper like that,"" said Scarfe bitterly.  ""Couldn't you see he hit you by accident?""  ""He did it on purpose,"" said Jeffreys savagely.  ""Nonsense.  He was aiming at the goal and missed.  You did the same thing yourself, only you aimed at him.""  ""I wish I had hit him!"" growled Jeffreys, glaring first at Scarfe, than at Forrester, and finally shambling off the ground.  ""There's a nice amiable lamb,"" said Forrester, as he watched the retreating figure.  ""I'm sometimes half ashamed to bait him, he does get into such tantrums.  But it's awfully tempting.""  ""You'd better keep out of his way the rest of the day,"" said Scarfe.  ""Oh, bless you, he'll have worked it off in half an hour.  What do you bet I don't get him to do my Latin prose for me this afternoon?""  Forrester knew his man; and that afternoon, as if nothing had happened, the junior sat in the Cad's study, eating some of the Cad's bread and jam while the Cad wrote out the junior's exercise for him.    CHAPTER TWO.  A FOOTBALL TRAGEDY.  The two days' grace which Mr Frampton had almost reluctantly allowed before putting into execution his new rule of compulsory athletics told very much in his favour.  Bolsover, after the first shock, grew used to the idea and even resigned.  After all, it would be a variety, and things were precious dull as they were.  As to making a rule of it, that was absurd, and Frampton could hardly be serious when he talked of doing so.  But on Saturday, if it was fine, and they felt in the humour--well, they would see about it.  With which condescending resolution they returned to their loafings and novels and secret cigarettes, and tried to forget all about Mr Frampton.  But Mr Frampton had no idea of being forgotten.  He had the schoolmaster's virtue of enthusiasm, but he lacked the schoolmaster's virtue of patience.  He hated the dry-rot like poison, and could not rest till he had ripped up every board and rafter that harboured it.  Any ordinary reformer would have been satisfied with the week's work he had already accomplished.  But Mr Frampton added yet another blow at the very heart of the dry-rot before the week was out.  On the day before the football match Bolsover was staggered, and, so to speak, struck all of a heap by the announcement that in future the school tuck-shop would be closed until after the dinner hour!  Fellows stared at one another with a sickly, incredulous smile when they first heard the grim announcement and wondered whether, after all, the new head-master _was_ an escaped lunatic.  A few gifted with more presence of mind than others bethought them of visiting the shop and of dispelling the hideous nightmare by optical demonstration.  Alas! the shutters were up.  Mother Partridge was not at the receipt of custom, but instead, written in the bold, square hand of Mr Frampton himself, there confronted them the truculent notice, ""The shop will for the future be open only before breakfast and after dinner.""  ""Brutal!"" gasped Farfield, as he read it.  ""Does he mean to starve us as well as drown us?""  ""Hard lines for poor old Mother Partridge,"" suggested Scarfe.  This cry took.  There was somehow a lurking sense of shame which made it difficult for Bolsover to rise in arms on account of the injury done to itself.  Money had been wasted, appetites had been lost, digestions had been ruined in that shop, and they knew it.  If you had put the question to any one of the boys who crowded down, hungry after their bath, to breakfast on the day of the football match, he would have told you that Frampton was as great a brute as ever, and that it was a big shame to make fellows play whether they liked it or not.  For all that, he would tell you, _he_ was going to play, much as he hated it, to avoid a row.  And if you had pressed him further he would have confided to you that it was expected the School would beat the Sixth, and that he rather hoped, as he must play, he would get a chance at the ball before the match was over.  From all which you might gather that Bolsover was reluctantly coming round to take an interest in the event.  ""Fortune favours the brave,"" said Mr Steele, one of his assistants, to the head-master at dinner-time.  ""You have conquered before you have struck, mighty Caesar.""  Mr Frampton smiled.  He was flushed and excited.  Two days ago he had seemed to be committed to a desperate venture.  Now, a straight path seemed to open before him, and Bolsover, in his enthusiastic imagination, was already a reformed, reinvigorated institution.  ""Yes, Steele,"" said he, as he glanced from the window and watched the boys trooping down towards the meadow.  ""This day will be remembered at Bolsover.""  Little dreamed the brave head-master how truly his prophecy would be fulfilled.  An arrangement had been made to give the small boys a match of their own.  The young gladiators themselves, who had secretly wept over their impending doom, were delighted to be removed beyond the reach of the giants of the Sixth.  And the leaders of the School forces were devoutly thankful to be disencumbered of a crowd of meddlesome ""kids"" who would have spoiled sport, even if they did not litter the ground with their corpses.  The sight of the new goal posts and ball, which Mr Freshfield, a junior master, was heard to explain was a present from the head-master to the school, had also a mollifying effect.  And the bracing freshness of the air and the self-respect engendered by the sensation of their flannels (for most of the players had contrived to provide themselves with armour of this healthy material) completed their reconciliation to their lot, and drove all feelings of resentment against their tyrant, for the present at any rate, quite out of their heads.  In a hurried consultation of the seniors, Farfield, who was known to be a player, was nominated captain of the senior force; while a similar council of war among the juniors had resulted in the appointment of Ranger of the Fifth to lead the hosts of the School.  Mr Freshfield, with all the ardour of an old general, assisted impartially in advising as to the disposition of the field on either side; and, for the benefit of such as might be inexperienced at the game, rehearsed briefly some of the chief rules of the game as played under the Rugby laws.  ""Now, are you ready?"" said he, when all preliminaries were settled, and the ball lay, carefully titled, ready for Farfield's kick-off.  ""Wait a bit,"" cried some one.  ""Where's Jeffreys?""  Where, indeed?  No one had noticed his absence till now; and one or two boys darted off to look for him.  But before they had gone far a white apparition appeared floundering across the meadow in the direction of the goals; and a shout of derisive welcome rose, as Jeffreys, arrayed in an ill-fitting suit of white holland, and crowned with his blue flannel cap, came on to the scene.  ""He's been sewing together the pillow-cases to make his trousers,"" said some one.  ""Think of a chap putting on his dress shirt to play football in,"" cried another.  ""Frampton said we were to wear the oldest togs we'd got,"" said a third, ""not our Sunday best.""  Jeffreys, as indeed it was intended, heard these facetious remarks on his strange toilet, and his brow grew heavy.  ""Come on,"" said Scarfe, as he drew near, ""it wasn't fair to the other side for you not to play.""  ""I couldn't find my boots,"" replied the Cad shortly, scowling round him.  ""Perhaps you'll play forward,"" said Farfield, ""and if ever you don't know what to do, go and stand outside those flag posts, and for mercy's sake let the ball alone.""  ""Boo-hoo!  I _am_ in such a funk,"" cried Forrester with his mocking laugh.  ""Thank goodness I'm playing back.""  ""Come now,"" called Mr Freshfield impatiently, ""are you ready?  Kick off, Farfield.  Look out, School.""  Next moment the match had begun.  As might have been expected, there was at first a great deal more confusion than play.  Bolsover was utterly unused to doing anything together, and football of all games needs united action.  There was a great deal of scrimmaging, but very few kicks and very few runs.  The ball was half the time invisible, and the other half in touch.  Mr Freshfield had time after time to order a throw-in to be repeated, or rule a kick as ""off-side.""  The more ardent players forgot the duty of protecting their flanks and rear; and the more timid neglected their chances of ""piling up"" the scrimmages.  The Sixth got in the way of the Sixth, and the School often spoiled the play of the School.  But after a quarter of an hour or so the chaos began to resolve itself, and each side, so to speak, came down to its bearings.  Mr Frampton, as he walked across from the small boys' match, was surprised as well as delighted to notice the business-like way in which the best players on either side were settling down to their work.  There was Farfield, flushed and dogged, leading on his forwards, and always on the ball. There was Scarfe, light and dodgy, ready for a run or a neat drop-kick from half-back.  There was Ranger and Phipps of the Fifth, backing one another up like another Nisus and Euryalus.  There was young Forrester, merry and plucky, saving his goal more than once by a prompt touch-down. There, even, was the elephantine Jeffreys, snorting and pounding in the thick of the fray, feeling his feet under him, and doing his clumsy best to fight the battle of his side.  The game went hard against the School, despite their determined rallies and gallant sorties.  Young Forrester in goal had more than one man's share of work; and Scarfe's drops from the rear of the Sixth scrimmage flew near and still nearer the enemy's goal.  Once, just before half-time, he had what seemed a safe chance, but at the critical moment Jeffreys' ungainly bulk interposed, and received on his chest the ball which would certainly have carried victory to his side.  ""Clumsy lout!"" roared Farfield; ""didn't I tell you to stand out of the way and not go near the ball--you idiot!  Go and play back, do.""  Jeffreys turned on him darkly.  ""You think I did it on purpose,"" said he.  ""I didn't.""  ""Go and play back!"" repeated Farfield--""or go and hang yourself.""  Jeffreys took a long breath, and departed with a scowl to the rear.  ""Half-time!"" cried Mr Freshfield.  ""Change sides.""  It was a welcome summons.  Both sides needed a little breathing space to gird themselves for the final tussle.  The School was elated at having so far eluded actual defeat, and cheerily rallied their opponents as they crossed over.  Jeffreys, in particular, as he made moodily to his new station, came in for their jocular greetings.  ""Thanks awfully, Cad, old man!"" cried one; ""we knew you'd give us a leg up.""  ""My word! doesn't he look pleased with himself!"" said another.  ""No wonder!""  ""Is that the way they taught you to play football at home?"" said young Forrester, emphasising his question with an acorn neatly pitched at the Cad's ear.  Jeffreys turned savagely with lifted arm, but Forrester was far beyond his enemy's reach, and his hand dropped heavily at his own side as he continued his sullen march to the Sixth's goal.  ""Are you ready?"" shouted Mr Freshfield.  ""Kick off.  Ranger!  Look out, Sixth!""  The game recommenced briskly.  The School, following up the advantage of their kick-off, and cheered by their recent luck, made a desperate onslaught into the enemy's territory, which for a while took all the energy of the Sixth to repel.  Phipps and Ranger were irrepressible, and had it not been for the steady play of Scarfe and the Sixth backs, that formidable pair of desperadoes might have turned the tide of victory by their own unaided exertions.  In the defence of the seniors, Jeffreys, it need hardly be said, took no part.  He stood moodily near one of the posts, still glaring in the direction of his insulters, and apparently heedless of the fortunes, of the game.  His inaction, however, was not destined to last long.  The second half game had lasted about a quarter of an hour, and the School was still stubbornly holding their advanced position in the proximity of the enemy's goal, when the ball suddenly, and by one of those mysterious chances of battle, burst clear of the scrimmage and darted straight to where Jeffreys stood.  ""Pick it up and run--like mad!"" shouted Farfield.  With a sudden swoop which astonished his beholders the Cad pounced on the ball and started to run in the direction of the ill-protected goal of the School.  Till they saw him in motion with an almost clear field ahead, no one had had any conception how powerfully he was built or how fast he could run. The School, rash and sanguine of victory, had pressed to the front, leaving scarcely half a dozen behind to guard their rear.  Three of these Jeffreys had passed before the School was well aware what he was doing.  Then a shout of consternation arose, mingled with the frantic cheers of the Sixth.  ""Collar him!  Have him over!  Stop him there!  Look out in goal!""  But Jeffreys was past stopping.  Like a cavalry charger who dashes on to the guns heedless of everything, and for the time being gone mad, so the Bolsover Cad, with the shouts behind him and the enemy's goal in front, saw and heard nothing else.  The two men who stepped out at him were brushed aside like reeds before a boat's keel; and with half the field before him only one enemy remained between him and victory.  That enemy was young Forrester!  There was something almost terrible in the furious career of the big boy as he bore down on the fated goal. Those behind ceased to pursue, and watched the result in breathless suspense.  Even the saucy light on Forrester's face faded as he hesitated a moment between fear and duty.  ""Collar him there!"" shouted the School.  ""He'll pass him easily,"" said the Sixth.  Forrester stepped desperately across his adversary's path, resolved to do his duty, cost what it might.  Jeffreys never swerved from his course, right or left.  ""He's going to charge the youngster!"" gasped Farfield.  Forrester, who had counted on the runner trying to pass him, became suddenly aware that the huge form was bearing straight down upon him.  The boy was no coward, but for a moment he stood paralysed.  That moment was fatal.  There was a crash, a shout!  Next moment Jeffreys was seen staggering to his feet and carrying the ball behind the goal.  But no one heeded him.  Every eye was turned to where young Forrester lay on his back motionless, with his face as white as death.    CHAPTER THREE.  GONE!  It would be difficult to picture the horror and dismay which followed the terrible termination to the football match described in our last chapter.  For a second or two every one stood where he was, as if rooted to the ground.  Then with an exclamation of horror Mr Freshfield bounded to the side of the prostrate boy.  ""Stand back and give him air!"" cried the master, as the school closed round and gazed with looks of terror on the form of their companion.  He lay with one arm above his head just as he had fallen.  His cap lay a yard or two off where he had tossed it before making his final charge. His eyes were closed, and the deathly pallor of his face was unmoved by even a quiver of life.  ""He's dead!"" gasped Farfield.  Mr Freshfield, who had been hastily loosening Forrester's collar, and had rested his hand for an instant on his heart, looked up with a face almost as white as the boy's and said--  ""Go for the doctor!--and some water.""  Half a dozen boys started--thankful to do anything.  Before the ring could close up again the ungainly form of Jeffreys, still panting from his run, elbowed his way to the front.  As his eyes fell on the form of his victim his face turned an ashy hue.  Those who watched him saw that he was struggling to speak, but no words came.  He stood like one turned suddenly to stone.  But not for long.  With a cry something resembling a howl, the school by a sudden simultaneous movement turned upon him.  He put up his hand instinctively, half-deprecatingly, half in self- defence.  Then as his eyes dropped once more on the motionless form over which Mr Freshfield was bending, he took half a step forward and gasped, ""I did not--""  Whatever he had intended to say was drowned by another howl of execration.  The sound of his voice seemed to have opened the floodgates and let loose the pent-up feelings of the onlookers.  A score of boys rushed between him and his victim and hustled him roughly out of the ring.  ""Murderer!"" cried Scarfe as he gave the first thrust.  And amidst echoes of that terrible cry the Cad was driven forth.  Once he turned with savage face, as though he would resist and fight his way back into the ring.  But it was only for a moment.  It may have been a sudden glimpse of that marble face on the grass, or it may have been terror.  But his uplifted hand fell again at his side, and he dragged himself dejectedly to the outskirts of the crowd.  There he still hovered, his livid face always turned towards the centre, drinking in every sound and marking every movement, but not attempting again to challenge the resentment of his school-fellows by attempting to enter the awe-struck circle.  It seemed an age before help came.  The crowd stood round silent and motionless, with their eyes fixed on the poor lifeless head which rested on Mr Freshfield's knee; straining their eyes for one sign of animation, yearning still more for the arrival of the doctor.  Mr Freshfield did not dare to lift the form, or even beyond gently raising the head, to move it in any way.  How anxiously all watched as, when the water arrived, he softly sponged the brow and held the glass to the white lips!  Alas! the dark lashes still drooped over those closed eyes, and as each moment passed Bolsover felt that it stood in the shadow of death.  At last there was a stir, as the sound of wheels approached in the lane. And presently the figure of the doctor, accompanied by Mr Frampton, was seen running across the meadow.  As they reached the outskirts of the crowd, Jeffreys laid his hand on the doctor's arm with an appealing gesture.  ""I did not mean--"" he began.  But the doctor passed on through the path which the crowd opened for him to the fallen boy's side.  It was a moment of terrible suspense as he knelt and touched the boy's wrist, and applied his ear to his chest.  Then in a hurried whisper he asked two questions of Mr Freshfield, then again bent over the inanimate form.  They could tell by the look on his face as he looked up that there was hope--for there was life!  ""He's not dead!"" they heard him whisper to Mr Frampton.  Still they stood round, silent and motionless.  The relief itself was terrible.  He was not dead, but would those deep-fringed eyes ever open again?  The doctor whispered again to Mr Frampton and Mr Freshfield, and the two passed their hands under the prostrate form to lift it.  But before they could do so the doctor, who never took his eyes off the boy's face, held up his hand suddenly, and said ""No!  Better have a hurdle,"" pointing to one which lay not far off on the grass.  A dozen boys darted for it, and a dozen more laid their coats upon it to make a bed.  Once more, amid terrible suspense, they saw the helpless form raised gently and deposited on the hurdle.  A sigh of relief escaped when the operation was over, and the sad burden, supported at each corner by the two masters, Scarfe and Farfield, began to move slowly towards the school.  ""Slowly, and do not keep step.  Above all things avoid a jolt,"" said the doctor, keeping the boy's hand in his own.  The crowd opened to let them pass, and then followed in mournful procession.  As the bearers passed on, Jeffreys, who all this time had been forgotten, but who had never once turned his face from where Forrester lay, stepped quickly forward as though to assist in carrying the litter.  His sudden movement, and the startling gesture that accompanied it, disconcerted the bearers, and caused them for a moment to quicken their step, thus imparting an unmistakable shock to the precious burden.  The doctor uttered an exclamation of vexation and ordered a halt. ""Stand back, sir!"" he cried angrily, waving Jeffreys back; ""a jolt like that may be fatal!""  An authority still more potent than that of the doctor was at hand to prevent a recurrence of the danger.  Jeffreys was flung out of reach of the litter by twenty angry hands and hounded out of the procession.  He did not attempt to rejoin it.  For a moment he stood and watched it as it passed slowly on.  A cold sweat stood on his brow, and every breath was a gasp.  Then he turned slowly back to the spot where Forrester had fallen, and threw himself on the ground in a paroxysm of rage and misery.  It was late and growing dark as he re-entered the school.  There was a strange, weird silence about the place that contrasted startlingly with the usual evening clamour.  The boys were mostly in their studies or collected in whispering groups in the schoolrooms.  As Jeffreys entered, one or two small boys near the door hissed him and ran away.  Others who met him in the passage and on the stairs glared at him with looks of mingled horror and aversion, which would have frozen any ordinary fellow.  Jeffreys, however, did not appear to heed it, still less to avoid it. Entering the Sixth Form room, he found most of his colleagues gathered, discussing the tragedy of the day in the dim light of the bay window. So engrossed were they that they never noticed his entrance, and it was not till after standing a minute listening to their talk he broke in, in his loud tones--  ""Is Forrester dead?""  The sound of his voice, so harsh and unexpected, had the effect of an explosion in their midst.  They recoiled from it, startled and half-scared.  Then, quickly perceiving the intruder, they turned upon him with a howl.  But this time the Cad did not retreat before them.  He held up his hand to stop them with a gesture almost of authority.  ""Don't!"" he exclaimed.  ""I'll go.  But tell me, some one, is he dead?""  His big form loomed out in the twilight a head taller than any of his companions, and there was something in his tone and attitude that held them back.  ""You will be sorry to hear,"" said Scarfe, one of the first to recover his self-control, and with a double-edge of bitterness in his voice, ""that he was alive an hour ago.""  Jeffreys gave a gasp, and held up his hand again.  ""Is there hope for him, then?""  ""Not with you in the school, you murderer!"" exclaimed Farfield, advancing on the Cad, and striking him on the mouth.  Farfield had counted the cost, and was prepared for the furious onslaught which he felt certain would follow.  But Jeffreys seemed scarcely even to be aware of the blow.  He kept his eyes on Scarfe, to whom he had addressed his last question, and said--  ""You won't believe me.  I didn't mean it.""  ""Don't tell lies,"" said Scarfe, ""you did--coward!""  Jeffreys turned on his heel with what sounded like a sigh.  The fury of his companions, which had more than once been on the point of breaking loose in the course of the short conference, vented itself in a howl as the door closed behind him.  And yet, some said to themselves, would a murderer have stood and faced them all as he had done?  The long night passed anxiously and sleeplessly for most of the inhabitants of Bolsover.  The event of the day had awed them into something like a common feeling.  They forgot their own petty quarrels and grievances for the time, and thought of nothing but poor Forrester.  The doctor and Mr Frampton never quitted his room all night.  Boys who, refusing to go to bed, sat anxiously, with their study doors open, eager to catch the first sound proceeding from that solemn chamber, waited in vain, and dropped asleep where they sat as the night gave place to dawn. Even the masters hovered restlessly about with careworn faces, and full of misgivings as hour passed hour without tidings.  At length--it was about ten o'clock, and the school bell was just beginning to toll for morning chapel--the door opened, and Mr Frampton stepped quickly out of the sick-room.  ""Stop the bell at once!"" he said.  Then Forrester must still be living!  ""How is he?"" asked a dozen voices, as the head-master passed down the corridor.  ""There is hope,"" said Mr Frampton, ""and, thank God! signs of returning consciousness.""  And with that grain of comfort wearied Bolsover filed slowly into church.  As Mr Frampton reached his study door he found Scarfe and Farfield waiting for him.  ""Well?"" said he wearily, seeing that they had something to say.  ""Come in.""  They followed him into the room.  ""Is there really hope?"" said Scarfe, who truly loved the injured boy.  ""I think so.  He never moved or showed sign of life, except the beating of his heart, till an hour ago.  Then he moved his head and opened his eyes.""  ""Did he know you, sir?""  ""The doctor thinks he did.  But everything depends now on quiet and care.""  ""We wanted to speak to you, sir, about the--the accident,"" said Farfield with a little hesitation.  ""Yes.  I have hardly heard how it happened, except that he fell in attempting to collar Jeffreys.  Was it not so?""  ""Yes, sir,"" replied Farfield.  ""But--""  ""Well, what?"" asked Mr Frampton, noticing his hesitation.  ""We don't feel sure that it was altogether an accident,"" said Farfield.  ""What!  Do you mean that the boy was intentionally injured?""  ""Jeffreys might easily have run round him.  Anybody else would.  He had the whole field to himself, and no one even near him behind.""  ""But was it not Forrester who got in front of him?""  ""Of course he tried to collar him, sir,"" said Scarfe; ""but he's only a little boy, and Jeffreys is a giant.  Jeffreys might have fended him off with his arm, as he did the other fellows who had tried to stop him, or he might have run round him.  Instead of that,""--and here the speaker's voice trembled with indignation--""he charged dead at him, and ran right over him.""  Mr Frampton's face clouded over.  ""Jeffreys is a clumsy fellow, is he not?"" he asked.  ""Yes,"" said Scarfe; ""and if it had been any one else than Forrester, we should all have put it down to his stupidity.""  ""You mean,"" said the head-master, ""that he had a quarrel with Forrester?""  ""He hated Forrester.  Every one knew that.  Forrester used to make fun of him and enrage him.""  ""And you mean to tell me you believe this big boy of nineteen, out of revenge, deliberately ran over young Forrester in the way you describe?""  ""I'm sure of it, sir,"" said Farfield unhesitatingly.  ""No one doubts it,"" said Scarfe.  Mr Frampton took an uneasy turn up and down the room.  He hated tale- bearers; but this seemed a case in which he was bound to listen and inquire further.  ""Scarfe and Farfield,"" said he, after a long pause, ""you know of course as well as I do the nature of the charge you are bringing against your schoolfellow--the most awful charge one human being can bring against another.  Are you prepared to repeat all you have said to me in Jeffreys' presence to-morrow, and before the whole school?""  ""Certainly, sir,"" said both boys.  ""It was our duty to tell you, sir,"" said Scarfe; ""and only fair to poor young Forrester.""  ""Nothing less than a sense of duty could justify the bringing of such a terrible accusation,"" said the head-master, ""and I am relieved that you are prepared to repeat it publicly--to-morrow.  For to-day, let us thank God for the hope He gives us of the poor sufferer.  Good-bye.""  Much as he could have wished it, it was impossible for Mr Frampton, wearied out as he was with his night's watching, to dismiss from his mind the serious statement which his two senior boys had made.  The responsibility which rested on him in consequence was terrible, and it required all his courage to face it.  That afternoon he sent for Mr Freshfield, and repeated to him the substance of the accusation against Jeffreys, asking him if he had noticed anything calculated to confirm the suspicion expressed by the boys.  Mr Freshfield was naturally very much startled.  ""If you had not mentioned it,"" he said, ""I should never have dreamed of such a thing.  But I confess I have noticed that Forrester and Jeffreys were on bad terms.  Forrester is a mischievous boy, and Jeffreys, who you know is rather a lout, seems to have been his special butt.  I am afraid, too, that Jeffreys' short temper rather encouraged his tormentors.""  ""Yes, but about the accident,"" said Mr Frampton; ""you were on the ground, you know.  Did you notice anything then?""  ""There was a little horseplay as the sides were changing over at half- time.  Forrester, among others, was taunting Jeffreys with a bad piece of play, and threw something at him.  I was rather struck by the look almost of fury which passed across Jeffreys' face.  But it seemed to me he got better of his feelings with an effort and went on without heeding what was said to him.""  ""That was not long before the accident?""  ""About a quarter of an hour.  His run down the field at the last was really a good piece of play, and every one seemed surprised.  But there was any amount of room and time to get past Forrester instead of charging right on to him.  It's possible, of course, he may have lost his head and not seen what he was doing.""  Mr Frampton shrugged his shoulders.  ""Well,"" said he with a dejected look, ""I wish you could have told me anything but what you have.  At any rate, to-morrow morning the matter must be faced and decided upon.  Jeffreys is unpopular in the school, is he not?""  ""Most unpopular,"" said Mr Freshfield.  ""That will make our responsibility all the greater,"" said the head- master.  ""He will have every one's hand against him.""  ""And you may be quite certain he will do himself injustice.  He always does.  But what of Forrester?""  ""He is conscious, and has taken some nourishment; that is all I can say, except, indeed,"" added Mr Frampton, with a groan, ""that if he lives the doctor says it will be as a cripple.""  The day dragged wearily on, and night came at last.  Most of the boys, worn-out with their last night's vigil, went to bed and slept soundly. The doctor, too, leaving his patient in the charge of a trained nurse, specially summoned, returned home, reporting hopefully of the case as he departed.  In two studies at Bolsover that night, however, there was no rest.  Far into the night Mr Frampton paced to and fro across the floor.  His hopes and ambitions had fallen like a house of cards.  The school he had been about to reform and regenerate had sunk in one day lower than ever before.  There was something worse than dry-rot in it now.  But Mr Frampton was a brave man; and that night he spent in arming himself for the task that lay before him.  Yet how he dreaded that scene to-morrow! How he wished that this hideous nightmare were after all a dream, and that he could awake and find Bolsover where it was even yesterday morning!  The other watcher was Jeffreys.  He had slept not a wink the night before, and to-night sleep seemed still more impossible.  Had you seen him as he sat there listlessly in his chair, with his gaunt, ugly face and restless lips, you would have been inclined, I hope, to pity him, cad as he was.  Hour after hour he sat there without changing his posture, cloud after cloud chasing one another across his brow, as they chased one another across the pale face of the moon outside.  At length, as it seemed, with an effort he rose to his feet and slipped off his boots.  His candle had burned nearly out, but the moon was bright enough to light his room without it, so he extinguished it and softly opened the door.  The passage was silent, the only sounds being the heavy breathing somewhere of a weary boy, and the occasional creaking of a board as he crept along on tip-toe.  At the end of the passage he turned aside a few steps to a door, and stood listening.  Some one was moving inside.  There was the rustle of a dress and the tinkle of a spoon in a cup.  Then he heard a voice, and oh, how his heart beat as he listened!  ""I'm tired,"" it said wearily.  That was all.  Jeffreys heard the smoothing of a pillow and a woman's soothing whisper hushing the sufferer to rest.  The drops stood in beads on his brow as he stood there and listened.  In a little all became quiet, and presently a soft, regular breathing told him that some one was sleeping.  He put his hand cautiously to the handle and held it there a minute before he dared turn it.  At last he did so, and opened the door a few inches.  The breathing went regularly on.  Inch by inch he pushed the door back till he could catch a glimpse in the moonlight of the bed, and a dark head of hair on the pillow.  An inch or two more, and he could see the whole room and the nurse dozing in the corner.  Stealthily, like a thief, he advanced into the room and approached the bed.  The sufferer was lying motionless, and still breathing regularly.  Jeffreys took a step forward to look at his face.  At that moment the moonlight streamed in at the window and lit up the room.  Then, to his terror, he noticed that the patient was awake, and lying with eyes wide open gazing at the ceiling.  Suddenly, and before Jeffreys could withdraw, the eyes turned and met his.  For an instant they rested there vacantly, then a gasp and a shriek of horror proclaimed that Forrester had recognised him.  In a moment he was outside the door, and had closed it before the nurse started up from her slumber.  He had not been in his study a minute when he heard a sound of footsteps and whispered voices without.  The boy's cry had reached the wakeful ears of Mr Frampton, and already he was on his way to the sick-chamber.  Jeffreys sank down on his bed in an agony of terror and suspense.  The boy's cry resounded in his ears and deafened him, till at last he could endure it no longer.  Next morning, when the school was gathered in the hall, after prayers, Mr Frampton, looking round him, missed the figure that was uppermost in his thoughts.  ""Will some one tell Jeffreys to come here?"" he said.  Mr Freshfield went, but returned suddenly to announce that Jeffreys' study was empty, and that a rope formed of sheets suspended from his window made it evident he had escaped in the night and quitted Bolsover.    CHAPTER FOUR.  GONE AGAIN.  On the evening following Jeffreys' departure from Bolsover, a middle- aged, handsome gentleman was sitting in his comfortable study in the city of York, whistling pleasantly to himself.  The house in which he lived was a small one, yet roomy enough for an old bachelor.  And what it wanted in size it made up for in the elegance and luxury of its furniture and adornments.  Mr Halgrove was evidently a connoisseur in the art of making himself comfortable.  Everything about him was of the best, and bespoke not only a man of taste but a man of means.  The books on the shelves--and where can you find any furniture to match a well-filled bookcase?--were well chosen and well bound.  The pictures on the walls were all works of art and most tastefully hung.  The knickknacks scattered about the room were ornamental as well as useful.  Even the collie dog which lay luxuriously on the hearthrug with one eye half open was as beautiful as he was faithful.  Mr Halgrove whistled pleasantly to himself as he stirred his coffee and glanced down the columns of the London paper.  If you had looked over his shoulder, you would have come to the conclusion that Mr Halgrove's idea of what was interesting in a newspaper and your own by no means coincided.  He was, in fact, reading the money article, and running his eye skilfully among the mazes of the stocks and shares there reported.  Suddenly there was a ring at the hall door and a man's voice in the hall.  Next moment the study door opened, and amid the frantic rejoicings of Julius, John Jeffreys walked into the presence of his guardian.  He was haggard and travel-stained, and Mr Halgrove, in the midst of his astonishment, noticed that his boots were nearly in pieces. Bolsover was fifty-five miles from York, and the roads were rough and stony.  The guardian, whatever astonishment he felt at this unexpected apparition, gave no sign of it in his face, as he sat back in his chair and took several quiet whiffs of his weed before he addressed his visitor.  ""Ah!"" said he, ""you've broken up early.""  ""No, sir,"" said Jeffreys.  ""Please may I have something to eat?""  ""Help yourself to the bread and butter there,"" said Mr Halgrove, pointing to the remains of his own tea, ""and see if you can squeeze anything out of the coffee-pot.  If not, ring for some more hot water. Lie down, Julius!""  Jeffreys ate the bread and butter ravenously, and drank what was left in the coffee-pot and milk-jug.  Mr Halgrove went on with his cigar, watching his ward curiously.  ""The roads are rough for walking this time of the year,"" observed he.  ""Yes,"" said Jeffreys; ""I've walked all the way.""  ""Good exercise,"" said Mr Halgrove.  ""How long did it take you?""  ""I left Bolsover at half-past four this morning.""  Mr Halgrove looked at his watch.  ""Fifteen hours--a fairly good pace,"" said he.  A silence ensued, during which time guardian and ward remained eyeing one another, the one curiously, the other anxiously.  ""Why not sit down,"" said Mr Halgrove, when it became evident his ward was not going to open the conversation, ""after your long walk?""  Jeffreys dropped heavily into the chair nearest to him and Julius came up and put his head between his knees.  ""Do you often take country walks of this sort?"" said the guardian.  ""No, sir; I've run away from Bolsover.""  Mr Halgrove raised his eyebrows.  ""Indeed!  Was it for the fun of the thing, or for any special reason?""  ""It was because I have killed a boy,"" said Jeffreys hoarsely.  It spoke volumes for Mr Halgrove's coolness that he took this alarming announcement without any sign of emotion.  ""Have you?"" said he.  ""And was that for fun, or for any special reason?""  ""I didn't mean it; it was an accident,"" said Jeffreys.  ""Is the story worth repeating?"" asked the guardian, knocking the ash off the end of the cigar, and settling himself in his chair.  Jeffreys told the story in a blundering, mixed-up way, but quite clearly enough for Mr Halgrove.  ""So you meant to run at him, though you didn't mean to kill him?"" said he, when the narrative was ended.  ""I did not mean to kill him,"" repeated the boy doggedly.  ""Of course it would not occur to you that you were twice his size and weight, and that running over him meant--well manslaughter.""  ""I never thought it for a moment--not for a moment.""  ""Was the accident fatal, at once, may I ask?""  ""No, sir; he was brought to the school insensible, and remained so for more than twelve hours.  Then he became conscious, and seemed to be doing well.""  ""A temporary rally, I suppose?"" observed the guardian.  Jeffreys' mouth worked uneasily, and his pale brow became overcast again.  ""No, I believe if it hadn't been for me he might have recovered.""  ""Indeed,"" said the other, once more raising his eyebrows; ""what further attention did you bestow on him--not poison, I hope?""  ""No, but I went to his room in the middle of the night and startled him, and gave him a shock.""  ""Yes; playing bogey is liable to alarm invalids.  I have always understood so,"" said Mr Halgrove drily.  ""I didn't mean to startle him.  I fancied he was asleep, and just wanted to see how he seemed to be getting on.  No one would tell me a word about him,"" said Jeffreys miserably.  ""And that killed him outright?""  ""I'm afraid it must have,"" said Jeffreys.  ""The doctor had said the least shock would be fatal, and this was a very great shock.""  ""It would be.  You did not, however, wait to see?""  ""No; I waited an hour or two, and then I ran away.""  ""Did you say good-bye to the head-master before leaving?""  ""No; nobody knew of my going.""  ""Of course you left your address behind you, in case you should be invited to attend the inquest.""  ""They know where I live,"" said Jeffreys.  ""Indeed!  And may _I_ ask where you live?""  The ward's face fell at the question.  ""Here, sir,"" faltered he.  ""Pardon me, I think you are mistaken, John Jeffreys.""  Jeffreys looked hard at his guardian, as if to ascertain whether or not he spoke seriously.  His one longing at that moment was for food and rest.  Since Saturday morning his eyes had never closed, and yet, strange as it may seem, he could take in no more of the future than what lay before him on this one night.  The sudden prospect now of being turned out into the street was overwhelming.  ""I think you are mistaken,"" repeated Mr Halgrove, tossing the end of his cigar into the fireplace and yawning.  ""But, sir,"" began Jeffreys, raising himself slowly to his feet, for he was stiff and cramped after his long journey, ""I've walked--""  ""So you said,"" interrupted Mr Halgrove, incisively.  ""You will be used to it.""  At that moment Jeffreys decided the question of his night's lodging in a most unlooked-for manner by doing what he had never done before, and what he never did again.  He fainted.  When he next was aware of anything he was lying in his own bed upstairs in broad daylight, and Mr Halgrove's housekeeper was depositing a tray with some food upon it at his side.  He partook gratefully, and dropped off to sleep again without rousing himself enough to recall the events of the past evening.  When, however, late in the afternoon, he awoke, and went over in his mind the events of the last few days, a dismal feeling of anxiety came over him and dispelled the comfort of his present situation.  He got out of bed slowly and painfully, for he was very stiff and footsore.  He knew not at what moment his guardian might return to the unpleasant topic of last night's conversation, and he resolved to end his own suspense as speedily as possible.  He took a bath and dressed, and then descended resolutely but with sad misgivings to the library.  Mr Halgrove was sitting where his ward had left him yesterday evening.  ""Ah,"" said he, as the boy entered, ""early rising's not your strong point, is it?""  ""I only woke half an hour ago.""  ""And you are anxious, of course, to know whether you have been inquired for by the police?"" said the guardian, paring his nails.  Jeffreys' face fell.  ""Has some one been?"" he asked.  ""Have you heard anything?""  ""No one has been as yet except the postman.  He brought me a letter from Bolsover, which will probably interest you more than it does me.  It's there on the table.""  Jeffreys took up a letter addressed in Mr Frampton's hand.  ""Am I to read it?""  ""As you please.""  Jeffreys opened the letter and read:--  ""Bolsover, _October_ 12.  ""S.  Halgrove, Esq.  ""Dear Sir,--I regret to inform you that your ward, John Jeffreys, left Bolsover secretly last night, and has not up to the present moment returned.  If he has returned to you, you will probably have learned by this time the circumstances which led him to take the step he has. (Here Mr Frampton briefly repeated the story of the football accident.) The patient still lingers, although the doctors do not at present hold out much hope of ultimate recovery.  I am not inclined to credit the statement current in the school with regard to the sad event, that the injury done to the small boy was not wholly due to accident.  Still, under the grave circumstances, which are made all the more serious by your ward's flight, I suggest to you that you should use your authority to induce Jeffreys to return here--at any rate for as long as Forrester's fate remains precarious; or, failing that, that you should undertake, in the event of a legal inquiry being necessary, that he shall be present if required.  ""Faithfully yours,--  ""T.  Frampton.""  ""Pleasant letter, is it not?"" said Mr Halgrove as Jeffreys replaced it in its envelope and laid it again on the table.  ""I can't go back to Bolsover,"" said he.  ""No?  You think you are not appreciated there?""  Jeffreys winced.  ""But I will undertake to go there if--""  ""If the coroner invites you, eh?""  ""Yes,"" replied the boy.  ""The slight difficulty about that is that it is I, not you, that am asked to make the undertaking.""  ""But you will, won't you?"" asked Jeffreys eagerly.  ""I have the peculiarity of being rather particular about the people I give undertakings for,"" said Mr Halgrove, flicking a speck of dust off his sleeve; ""it may be ridiculous, but I draw the line at homicide.""  ""You're a liar!"" exclaimed the ward, in a burst of fury, which, however, he repented of almost before the words had escaped him.  Mr Halgrove was not in the slightest degree disturbed by this undutiful outbreak, but replied coolly,--  ""In that case, you see, my undertaking would be worth nothing.  No. What do you say to replying to Mr Frampton's suggestion yourself?""  ""I will write and tell him I will go whenever he wants me.""  ""The only objection to that,"" observed the guardian, ""will be the difficulty in giving him any precise address, will it not?""  Jeffreys winced again.  ""You mean to turn me adrift?"" said he bluntly.  ""Your perception is excellent, my young friend.""  ""When?""  Mr Halgrove looked at his watch.  ""I believe Mrs Jessop usually locks up about eleven.  It would be a pity to keep her up after that hour.""  Jeffreys gulped down something like a sigh and turned to the door.  ""Not going, are you?"" said the guardian.  ""It's early yet.""  ""I am going,"" replied the ward quietly.  ""By the way,"" said Mr Halgrove, as he reached the door, ""by the way, John--""  Jeffreys stopped with his hand on the latch.  ""I was going to say,"" said the guardian, rising and looking for his cigar-case, ""that the little sum of money which was left by your father, and invested for your benefit, has very unfortunately taken to itself wings, owing to the failure of the undertaking in which it happened to be invested.  I have the papers here, and should like to show them to you, if you can spare me five minutes.""  Jeffreys knew nothing about money.  Hitherto his school fees had been paid, and a small regular allowance for pocket-money had been sent him quarterly by his guardian.  Now his guardian's announcement conveyed little meaning to him beyond the fact that he had no money to count upon.  He never expected he would have; so he was not disappointed.  ""I don't care to see the papers,"" he said.  ""You are a philosopher, my friend,"" said his guardian.  ""But I have sufficient interest in you, despite your financial difficulties, to believe you might find this five-pound note of service on your travels.""  ""No, thank you,"" said Jeffreys, putting his hand behind his back.  ""Don't mention it,"" said his guardian, returning it to his pocket. ""There is, when I come to think of it,"" added he, ""a sovereign which really belongs to you.  It is the balance of your last quarter's allowance, which I had been about to send to you this week.  I would advise you to take it.""  ""Is it really mine?""  ""Pray come and look over the accounts.  I should like to satisfy you.""  ""If it is really mine I will take it,"" said the boy.  ""You are sensible,"" said his guardian, putting it into his hand.  ""You are perfectly safe in taking it.  It is yours.  It will enable you to buy a few postage stamps.  I shall be interested to hear of your success.  Good-bye.""  Jeffreys, ignoring the hand which was held out to him, walked silently from the room.  Mr Halgrove stood a moment and listened to the retreating footsteps.  Then he returned to his chair and rang the bell.  ""Mrs Jessop,"" said he, ""Mr Jeffreys is going on a journey.  Will you kindly see he has a good meal before starting?""  Mrs Jessop went upstairs and found Jeffreys writing a letter.  ""Master says you're going a journey, sir.""  ""Yes.  I shall be starting in half an hour.""  ""Can't you put it off till to-morrow, sir?""  ""No, thanks.  But I want to finish this letter.""  ""Well, sir, there'll be some supper for you in the parlour.  It's master's orders.""  Jeffreys' letter was to Mr Frampton.  ""Sir,"" he wrote, ""I left Bolsover because I could not bear to be there any longer.  I did not mean to injure Forrester so awfully, though I was wicked enough to have a spite against him.  I am not a murderer, though I am as bad as one.  If I could do anything to help Forrester get better I would come, but I should only make everything worse.  My guardian has turned me away, and I shall have to find employment.  But the housekeeper here, Mrs Jessop, will always know where I am, and send on to me if I am wanted.  I should not think of hiding away till I hear that Forrester is better.  If he dies I should not care to live, so I should be only too glad to give myself up.  I cannot come back to Bolsover now, even if I wanted, as I have only a pound, and my guardian tells me that is all the money I have in the world.  Please write and say if Forrester is better.  I am too miserable to write more.  ""Yours truly,--  ""John Jeffreys.""  Having finished this dismal letter, he packed up one or two of his things in a small handbag and descended to the parlour.  There he found an ample supper provided for him by the tender-hearted Mrs Jessop, who had a pretty shrewd guess as to the nature of the ""journey"" that her master's ward was about to take.  But Jeffreys was not hungry, and the announcement that the meal was there by the ""master's orders"" turned him against it.  ""I can't eat anything, thank you,"" he said to Mrs Jessop, ""you gave me such a good tea only a little while ago.""  ""But you've a long journey, Master John.  Is it a long journey, sir?""  ""I don't know yet,"" he said.  ""But I want you to promise to send me on any letter or message that comes, will you?""  ""Where to?""  ""To the head post-office, here.""  ""Here?  Then you're not going out of York?""  ""Not at first.  I'll let you know when I go where to send on the letters.""  ""Mr John,"" said the housekeeper, ""the master's turned you away.  Isn't that it?""  ""Perhaps he's got a reason for it.  Good-bye, Mrs Jessop.""  ""Oh, but Mr John--""  But John interrupted her with a kiss on her motherly cheek, and next moment was gone.    CHAPTER FIVE.  FREDDY AND TEDDY.  John Jeffreys, as he stood in the street that October evening, had no more idea what his next step was to be than had Mr Halgrove or the motherly Mrs Jessop.  He was a matter-of-fact youth, and not much given to introspection; but the reader may do well on this particular occasion to take a hasty stock of him as he walked aimlessly down the darkening street.  He was nineteen years old.  In appearance he was particularly ugly in face and clumsy in build.  Against that, he was tall and unusually powerful whenever he chose to exert his strength.  In mind he was reputed slow and almost stupid, although he was a good classical scholar and possessed a good memory.  He was cursed with a bad and sometimes ungovernable temper.  He was honest and courageous.  He rarely knew how to do the right thing at the right time or in the right place.  And finally he had a bad name, and believed himself to be a homicide.  Such was the commonplace creature who, with a sovereign in his pocket and the whole world before him, paced the streets of York that Tuesday night.  On one point his mind was made up.  He must remain in York for the present, prepared at a moment's notice to repair to Bolsover, should the dreaded summons come.  With that exception, as I have said, his mind was open, and utterly devoid of ideas as to the future.  He directed his steps to the poor part of the town, not so much because it was poor, as because it was farthest away from his guardian's.  He resolved that to-night at any rate he would indulge in the luxury of a bed, and accordingly, selecting the least repulsive-looking of a number of tenements offering ""Cheap beds for Single Men,"" he turned in and demanded lodging.  To the end of his days he looked back on the ""cheap bed"" he that night occupied with a shudder.  And he was by no means a Sybarite, either.  Happily, he had still some sleep to make up; and despite his foul bed, his unattractive fellow-lodgers, and his own dismal thoughts, he fell asleep, in his clothes and with his bag under his pillow, and slept till morning.  He partook of a cheap breakfast at a coffee-stall on one of the bridges, and occupied the remainder of the time before the opening of business houses in wandering about on the city walls, endeavouring to make up his mind what calling in life he should seek to adopt.  He had not decided this knotty point when the minster chimes struck ten, and reminded him that he was letting the precious moments slip.  So he descended into the streets, determined to apply for the first vacancy which presented itself.  Wandering aimlessly on, he came presently upon a bookseller's shop, outside which were displayed several trays of second-hand volumes which attracted his attention.  Jeffreys loved books and was a voracious reader, and in the midst of his wearisome search for work it was like a little harbour of refuge to come upon a nest of them here.  Just, however, as he was about to indulge in the delicious luxury of turning over the contents of the tempting trays, his eye was attracted by a half-sheet of note-paper gummed on to the shop window and bearing the inscription, ""Assistant wanted.  Apply within.""  Next instant Jeffreys stood within.  ""I see you want an assistant,"" said he to the old spectacled bookseller who inquired his business.  ""That's right.""  ""Will you take me?""  The man glanced up and down at his visitor and said doubtfully,--  ""Don't know you--are you in the trade?""  ""No, I've just left school.""  ""What do you know about books?""  ""I love them,"" replied the candidate simply.  The bookseller's face lit up and shot a glow of hope into the boy's heart.  ""You love them.  I like that.  But take my advice, young fellow, and if you love books, don't turn bookseller.""  Jeffreys' face fell.  ""I'm not afraid of getting to hate them,"" said he.  The man beamed again.  ""What's your name, my lad?""  ""John Jeffreys.""  ""And you've just left school?  What school?""  Alas! poor Jeffreys!  It cost him a struggle to utter the name.  ""Bolsover.""  ""Bolsover, eh?  Do you know Latin?""  ""Yes--and Greek,"" replied the candidate.  The bookseller took up a book that lay on the table.  It was an old and valuable edition of Pliny's _Epistles_.  ""Read us some of that.""  Jeffreys was able fairly well to accomplish the task, greatly to the delight of the old bookseller.  ""Capital!  You're the first chap I ever had who could read Pliny off.""  Jeffreys' face lit up.  The man spoke as if the thing was settled.  ""How will fifteen shillings a week and your meals suit you?"" said he.  ""Perfectly!"" replied the candidate.  ""Hum! you've got a character, of course?""  Poor Jeffreys' face fell.  ""Do you mean testimonials?""  ""No.  You can refer to some one who knows you--your old schoolmaster, for instance.""  ""I'm afraid not,"" faltered the boy.  The man looked perplexed.  ""Couldn't get a character from him--why not?""  ""Because I ran away from school.""  ""Oh, oh!  Did they ill-treat you, then, or starve you?  Come; better tell the truth.""  ""No--it wasn't that.  It was because--"" Jeffreys gave one longing look at the shelves of beloved books, and an appealing glance at his questioner--""It was because I--nearly killed a boy.""  The man whistled and looked askance at his visitor.  ""By accident?""  ""Partly.  Partly not.  But I assure you--""  ""That will do,"" said the man; ""that's quite enough.  Be off!""  Jeffreys departed without another word.  Like Tantalus, the tempting fruit had been within reach, and his evil destiny had come in to dash it from his lips.  Was it wonderful if he felt disposed to give it up and in sheer desperation go back to Bolsover?  The whole of the remainder of that day was spent in spiritless wandering about the streets.  Once he made another attempt to obtain work, this time at a merchant's office.  But again the inconvenient question of character was raised, and he was compelled to denounce himself.  This time his confession was even more unfeelingly received than at the bookseller's.  ""How dare you come here, you scoundrel?"" exclaimed the merchant in a rage.  ""Don't call me a scoundrel!"" retorted Jeffreys, his temper suddenly breaking out.  ""I'll call a policeman if you are not out of here in half a minute. Here, you boys,"" added he, calling his six or eight clerks, ""turn this wretch out of the place.  Do you hear?""  Jeffreys spared them the trouble and stepped into the street, determined to die before he laid himself open to such an indignity again.  His last night's experience at a common lodging-house did not tempt him to seek shelter again now, and as it was a fine mild night even at that time of year he trudged out of York into one of the suburbs, where at least everything was clean and quiet.  He had the good fortune in a country lane to come across a wagon laid up by the roadside, just inside a field--a lodging far more tempting than that offered by Mr Josephs, and considerably cheaper.  The fatigues and troubles of the day operated like a feather-bed for the worn-out and dispirited outcast, and he slept soundly, dreaming of Forrester, and the bookshop, and the dog Julius.  Next morning the weary search began again.  Jeffreys, as he trudged back to the city, felt that he was embarked on a forlorn hope.  Yet a man must live, and a sovereign cannot last for ever.  He passed a railway embankment where a gang of navvies were hard at work.  As he watched them he felt half envious.  They had work to do, they had homes to return to at night, they had characters, perhaps.  Most of them were big strong fellows like himself.  Why should he not become one of them?  He fancied he could wheel a barrow, and ply a crowbar, and dig with a spade, as well as any of them; he was not afraid of hard work any more than they were, and the wages that kept a roof over their heads would surely keep a roof over his.  As he sat on a bank by the roadside and watched them, he had almost resolved to walk across to the foreman and ask for a job, when the sound of voices close to him arrested him.  They were boys' voices, and their talk evidently referred to himself, ""Come along, Teddy,"" said one.  ""He won't hurt.""  ""I'm afraid,"" said the other.  ""He's so ugly.""  ""Perhaps that's how he gets his living--scaring the crows,"" said the first speaker.  ""He looks as if he meant to kill us.""  ""I shall fight him if he tries.""  Jeffreys looked round and had a view of the valiant speaker and his companion.  They were two neatly dressed little fellows, hand-in-hand, and evidently brothers.  The younger--he who considered his life in danger--was about eight, his intrepid brother being apparently about a year his senior. They had little satchels over their shoulders, and parti-coloured cricket caps on their little curly heads.  Their faces were bright and shining, the knees of their stockings were elaborately darned, the little hands were unmistakably ink-stained, and their pockets were bulged out almost to bursting.  Such was the apparition which confronted the Bolsover ""cad"" as he sat slowly making up his mind to become a labourer.  The younger brother drew back and began to cry, as soon as he perceived that the terrible villain on the bank had turned and was regarding them.  ""Freddy, Freddy, run!"" he cried.  ""I shan't,"" said Freddy with a big heave of his chest.  ""I'm not afraid.""  The fluttering heart beneath that manly bosom belied the words, as Freddy, dragging his brother by the hand, walked forward.  Jeffreys did not exactly know what to do.  Were he to rise and approach the little couple the consequences might be disastrous.  Were he to remain where he was or skulk away, he would be allowing them to believe him the ruffian they thought him, and that lane would become a daily terror to their little lives.  The only thing was to endeavour to make friends.  ""What are you afraid of?"" said he, in as gentle a manner as he could. ""I won't hurt you.""  The sound of his voice caused the smaller boy to scream outright, and even the elder trembled a little as he kept himself full front to the enemy.  ""You little donkeys, I'm a schoolboy myself,"" said Jeffreys.  This announcement had a magical effect.  The younger brother stopped short in his scream, and Freddy boldly took two steps forward.  ""Are you a boy?"" inquired the latter.  ""Of course I am.  I was in the top form.  I'm older than you, though.""  ""I'm ten,"" replied the proud owner of that venerable age.  ""I'm nine in February,"" chimed in the still-fluttered junior.  ""I'm about as old as you two put together.  How old's that, Freddy?""  ""Nineteen,"" said Freddy.  By this time Jeffreys had gradually descended the bank and stood close to the two small brothers.  ""Bravo, young 'un, you can do sums, I see!""  ""Compound division and vulgar fractions,"" said Freddy confidentially.  Jeffreys gave a whistle of admiration which won the heart of his hearer.  ""Are you going to school now?"" inquired the latter.  ""No; I've left school,"" said Jeffreys, ""last week.""  ""Last week! why, it's only the middle of the term.  Were you sent away?""  Jeffreys began to feel uncomfortable in the presence of this small cross-examiner.  ""I got into trouble and had to leave.""  ""I know why,"" said the younger brother, plucking up courage.  ""Why?"" inquired Jeffreys, with an amused smile.  ""Because you were so ugly!""  Jeffreys laughed.  ""Thank you,"" said he.  ""Was it because you killed the master?"" asked the more matter-of-fact Freddy.  Poor Jeffreys winced before this random shot, and hastened to divert the conversation.  ""Whose school do you go to?"" he inquired.  ""Trimble's; we hate her,"" said the two youths in a breath.  ""Why?  Does she whack you?""  ""No; but she worries us, and young Trimble's worse still.  Do you know the school?""  ""No.  What's the name of the house?""  ""Oh, Galloway House, in Ebor Road.  It wasn't so bad when Fison was there,"" continued the open-hearted Freddy; ""but now he's gone. Trimble's a cad.""  ""We hate her,"" chimed in the original Teddy.  ""We hope the new master will be like Fison, but I don't believe Trimble can get any one to come,"" said Freddy.  Jeffreys pricked up his ears and asked a good many questions about the school, which the youthful pair readily and gaily replied to, and then suggested that if Trimble was such a cad the boys had better not be late.  ""Have some parliament cake?"" said Freddy, opening his satchel and producing a large square of crisp gingerbread.  Jeffreys had not the heart to refuse a little piece of this delicacy, and enjoyed it more than the most sumptuous meal in an hotel.  Teddy also insisted on his taking a bite out of his apple.  ""Good-bye,"" said the little fellow, putting up his face in the most natural manner for a kiss.  Jeffreys felt quite staggered by this unexpected attention, but recovered his presence of mind enough to do what was expected of him.  Freddy, on the other hand, looked rather alarmed at his young brother's audacity, and contented himself with holding out his hand.  ""Good-bye, little chap,"" said Jeffreys, feeling a queer lump in his throat and not exactly knowing which way to look.  Next moment the two little brothers were trotting down the road hand-in- hand as gay as young larks.  Jeffreys thought no more about the navvies, or the delights of a labourer's life.  A new hope was in him, and he strolled slowly back into York wondering to himself if angels ever come to men in the shape of little schoolboys.  It was still early when he reached the city.  So he spent sixpence of his little store on a bath in the swimming baths, and another sixpence on some breakfast.  Then, refreshed in body and mind, he called at the post-office.  There was nothing for him there.  Though he hardly expected any letter yet, his heart sunk as he thought what news might possibly be on its way to him at that moment.  The image of Forrester as he lay on the football field haunted him constantly, and he would have given all the world even then to know that he was alive.  Hope, however, came to his rescue, and helped him for a time to shake off the weight of his heart, and address himself boldly to the enterprise he had in hand.  That enterprise the acute reader has easily guessed.  He would offer his services to the worthy Mrs Trimble, _vice_ Mr Fison, resigned.  He never imagined his heart could beat as quickly as it did when after a long search he read the words--""Galloway House.  Select School for Little Boys,"" inscribed on a board in the front garden of a small, old- fashioned house in Ebor Road.  The sound of children's voices in the yard at the side apprised him that he had called at a fortunate time.  Mrs Trimble during the play-hour would in all probability be disengaged.  Mrs Trimble was disengaged, and opened the door herself.  Jeffreys beheld a stoutish harmless-looking woman, with a face by no means forbidding, even if it was decidedly unintellectual.  ""Well, young man,"" said she.  She had been eating, and, I regret to say, had not finished doing so before she began to speak.  ""Can I see Mrs Trimble, please?"" asked Jeffreys, raising his hat.  The lady, finding her visitor was a gentleman, hastily wiped her mouth and answered rather lest brusquely.  ""I am the lady,"" said she.  ""Excuse me,"" said Jeffreys, ""I called to ask if you were in want of an assistant teacher.  I heard that you were.""  ""How did you hear that, I wonder?  I suppose he's a friend of that Fison.  Yes, young man, I am in want of an assistant.""  ""I should do my best to please you, if you would let me come,"" said Jeffreys.  And then, anxious to avoid the painful subject of his character, he added, ""I have not taught in a school before, and I have no friends here, so I can't give you any testimonials.  But I am well up in classics and pretty good in mathematics, and would work hard, ma'am, if you would try me.""  ""Are you a steady young man?  Do you drink?""  ""I never touch anything but water; and I am quite steady.""  ""What wages do you expect?""  ""I leave that to you.  I will work for nothing for a month till you see if I suit you.""  Mrs Trimble liked this.  It looked like a genuine offer.  ""Are you good-tempered and kind to children?"" she asked.  ""I am very fond of little boys, and I always try to keep my temper.""  His heart sank at the prospect of other questions of this kind.  But Mrs Trimble was not of a curious disposition.  She knew when she liked a young man and when she didn't, and she valued her own judgment as much as anybody else's testimonials.  ""You mustn't expect grand living here,"" she said.  ""I was never used to anything but simple living,"" said he.  ""Very well, Mr --""  ""Jeffreys, ma'am.""  ""Mr Jeffreys, we'll try how we get on for a month; and after that I can offer you a pound a month besides your board.""  ""You are very kind,"" said Jeffreys, to whom the offer seemed a magnificent one.  ""I am ready to begin work at once.""  ""That will do.  You'd better begin now.  Come this way to the schoolroom.""    CHAPTER SIX.  GALLOWAY HOUSE.  My business-like readers have, I dare say, found fault with me for representing a business conference on which so much depended as having taken place on the front doorstep of Galloway House, and without occupying much more than five minutes in the transaction.  How did Jeffreys know what sort of person Mrs Trimble was?  She might have been a Fury or a Harpy.  Her house might have been badly drained.  Mr Fison might have left her because he couldn't get his wages.  And what did Mrs Trimble know about the Bolsover cad?  She never even asked for a testimonial.  He might be a burglar in disguise, or a murderer, or a child-eater.  And yet these two foolish people struck a bargain with one another five minutes after their first introduction, and before even the potatoes which Mrs Trimble had left on her plate when she went to the door had had time to get cold.  I am just as much surprised as the reader at their rashness, which I can only account for by supposing that they were both what the reader would call ""hard up.""  Jeffreys, as we know, was very hard up; and as for Mrs Trimble, the amount of worry she had endured since Mr Fison had left was beyond all words.  She had had to teach as well as manage, the thing she never liked.  And her son and assistant, without a second usher to keep him steady, had been turning her hair grey.  For three weeks she had waited in vain.  Several promising-looking young men had come and looked at the place and then gone away.  She had not been able to enjoy an afternoon's nap for a month.  In short, she was getting worn-out. When, therefore, Jeffreys came and asked for the post, she had to put a check on herself to prevent herself from ""jumping down his throat."" Hence the rapid conference at the hall door, and the ease with which Jeffreys got his footing in Galloway House.  ""Come and have a bite of mutton,"" said Mrs Trimble, leading the way into the parlour.  ""Jonah and I are just having dinner.""  Jonah, who, if truth must be told, had been neglecting his inner man during the last five minutes in order to peep through the crack of the door, and overhear the conference in the hall between his mother and the stranger, was a vulgar-looking youth of about Jeffrey's age, with a slight cast in his eye, but otherwise not bad-looking.  He eyed the new usher as he entered with a mingled expression of suspicion and contempt; and Jeffreys, slow of apprehension though he usually was, knew at a glance that he had not fallen on a bed of roses at Galloway House.  ""Jonah, this is Mr Jeffreys; I've taken him on in Fison's place.  My son, Mr Jeffreys.""  Jonah made a face at his mother, as much as to say, ""I don't admire your choice,"" and then, with a half-nod at Jeffreys, said,--  ""Ah, how are you?""  ""Jonah and I always dine at twelve, Mr Jeffreys,"" said Mrs Trimble, over whom the prospect of the afternoon's nap was beginning to cast a balmy sense of ease.  ""You two young men will be good friends, I hope, and look well after the boys.""  ""More than you do,"" said the undutiful Jonah; ""they've been doing just as they please the last month.""  ""It's a pity, Jonah, you never found fault with that before.""  ""What's the use of finding fault?  No end to it when you once begin.""  ""Well,"" observed the easy-going matron, ""you two will have to see I don't have occasion to find fault with you.""  Jonah laughed, and asked Jeffreys to cut him a slice of bread.  Presently Mrs Trimble quitted the festive board, and the two ushers were left together.  ""Lucky for you,"" said young Trimble, ""you got hold of ma and pinned her down to taking you on on the spot.  What's she going to pay you?""  The question did not altogether please the new assistant, but he was anxious not to come across his colleague too early in their acquaintanceship.  ""She pays me nothing the first month.  After that, if I suit, I'm to have a pound a month.""  ""If you suit?  I suppose you know that depends on whether I like you or not?""  ""I hope not,"" blurted out Jeffreys--""that is,"" added he, seeing his mistake, ""I hope we shall _get_ on well together.""  ""Depends,"" said Trimble.  ""I may as well tell you at once I hate stuck- uppedness (this was a compound word worthy of a young schoolmaster).  If you're that sort you'd better cry off at once.  If you can do your work without giving yourself airs, I shall let you alone.""  Jeffreys was strongly tempted after this candid avowal to take the youthful snob's advice and cry off.  But the memory of yesterday's miserable experiences restrained him.  He therefore replied, with as little contempt as he was able to put into the words,--  ""Thanks.""  Trimble's quick ear detected the ill-disguised scorn of the reply.  ""You needn't try on that sort of talk,"" said he; ""I can tell you plump, it won't do.  You needn't think because ma took you on for the asking, you're going to turn up your nose at the place!""  ""I don't think so,"" said Jeffreys, struggling hard with himself.  ""How many boys are there here?""  ""Forty-four.  Are you anything of a teacher?  Can you keep order?""  ""I don't know; I haven't tried yet.""  ""Well, just mind what you're about.  Keep your hands off the boys; we don't want manslaughter or anything of that sort here.""  Jeffreys started.  Was it possible that this was a random shot, or did Trimble know about Bolsover and young Forrester?  The next remark somewhat reassured him.  ""They're looking sharp after private schools now; so mind, hands off. There's one o'clock striking.  All in!  Come along.  You'd better take the second class and see what you can make of them.  Precious little ma will put her nose in, now you're here to do the work.""  He led the way down the passage and across a yard into an outhouse which formed the schoolroom.  Here were assembled, as the two ushers entered, some forty boys ranging in age from seven to twelve, mostly, to judge from their dress and manners, of the small shopkeeper and farmer class.  The sound of Trimble's voice produced a dead silence in the room, followed immediately by a movement of wonder as the big, ungainly form of the new assistant appeared.  Jeffreys' looks, as he himself knew, were not prepossessing, and the juvenile population of Galloway House took no pains to conceal the fact that they agreed with him.  ""Gordon,"" said Trimble, addressing a small boy who had been standing up when they entered, ""what are you doing?""  ""Nothing, sir.""  ""You've no business to be doing nothing!  Stand upon that form for an hour!""  The boy obeyed, and Trimble looked round at Jeffreys with a glance of patronising complacency.  ""That's the proper way to do with them,"" said he.  ""Plenty of ways of taking it out of them without knocking them about.""  Jeffreys made no reply; he felt rather sorry for the weak-kneed little youngster perched up on that form, and wondered if Mr Trimble would expect him (Jeffreys) to adopt his method of ""taking it out"" of his new pupils.  Just then he caught sight of the familiar face of Master Freddy, one of his friends of the morning, who was standing devouring him with his eyes as if he had been a ghost.  Jeffreys walked across the room and shook hands with him.  ""Well, Freddy, how are you?  How's Teddy?""  ""I say,"" said Trimble, in by no means an amiable voice, as he returned from this little excursion, ""what on earth are you up to?  What did you go and do that for?""  ""I know Freddy.""  ""Oh, do you?  Freddy Rosher, you're talking.  What do you mean by it?""  ""Please, sir, I didn't mean--""  ""Then stay in an hour after school, and write four pages of your copy- book.""  It took all Jeffreys' resolution to stand by and listen to this vindictive sentence without a protest.  But he restrained himself, and resolved that Freddy should find before long that all his masters were not against him.  ""That's your fault,"" said Trimble, noticing the dissatisfied look of his colleague.  ""How are we to keep order if you go and make the boys break rules?  Now you'd better get to work.  Take the second class over there and give them their English history.  James the Second they're at.  Now, you boys, first class, come up to me with your sums.  Second class, take your history up to Mr Jeffreys.  Come along; look alive!""  Jeffreys thereupon found himself mobbed by a troop of twenty of the youngest of the boys, and haled away to a desk at the far end of the room, round which they congregated book in hand, and waited for him to commence operations.  It was an embarrassing situation for the new usher.  He had never been so fixed before.  He had often had a crowd of small boys round him, tormenting him and provoking him to anger; but to be perched up here at a desk, with twenty tender youths hanging on the first word which should fall from his lips, was to say the least, a novel experience.  He glanced up towards the far end of the room, in the hopes of being able to catch a hint from the practised Jonah as to how to proceed.  But he found Jonah was looking at him suspiciously over the top of his book, and that was no assistance whatever.  The boys evidently enjoyed his perplexity; and, emboldened by his recent act of friendliness to the unlucky Freddy, regarded him benevolently.  ""Will some one lend me a book?"" at last said Jeffreys, half desperate.  A friendly titter followed this request.  ""Don't you know it without the book?"" asked one innocent, handing up a book.  ""I hope you do,"" said Jeffreys, blushing very much as he took it. ""Now,"" added he, turning to the reign of James II, ""can any one tell we what year King James II came to the throne?""  ""Please, sir, that's not the way,"" interposed another irreverent youngster, with a giggle.  ""You've got to read it first, and then ask us.""  Jeffreys blushed again.  ""Is that the way?"" said he.  ""Very well.  James II succeeded his brother Charles in 1685.  One of his first acts on coming--""  ""Oh, we're long past that,"" said two or three of his delighted audience at a breath; ""we've done to where Monmouth's head was cut off.""  This was very uncomfortable for the new master.  He coloured up, as if he had been guilty of a scandalous misdemeanour, and fumbled nervously with the book, positively dreading to make a fresh attempt.  At last, however, he summoned up courage.  ""The death of this ill-fated nobleman was followed by a still more terrible measure of retribution against those who had--""  ""Please, sir, we can't do such long words; we don't know what that means.  You've got to say it in easy words, not what's put in the book.""  Jeffreys felt that all the sins of his youth were rising up against him that moment.  Nothing that he had ever done seemed just then as bad as this latest delinquency.  ""After Monmouth's death they made it very--(hot, he was going to say, but he pulled himself up in time), they made it very (whatever was the word?)--very awkward for those who had helped him.  A cruel judge named Jeffreys--""  That was a finishing stroke!  The reader could have sunk through the floor as he saw the sensation which this denunciation of himself caused among his audience.  There was not a shadow of doubt in the face of any one of them as to his identity with the ferocious judge in question. What followed he felt was being listened to as a chapter or autobiography, and nothing he could say could now clear his character of the awful stain that rested upon it.  ""A cruel judge condemned more than three hundred persons--""  ""You forgot to say his name, please, sir,"" they put in.  ""Never mind his name; that is, I told you once, you should remember,"" stammered the hapless usher.  ""I remember it.  Jeffreys, wasn't it, Mr Jeffreys?"" said one boy triumphantly.  ""He condemned more than--""  ""Who, Jeffreys?""  What was the use of keeping it up?  ""Yes; this wicked judge, Jeffreys, condemned more than three hundred people to death, just because they had helped Monmouth.""  There was a low whistle of horror, as every eye transfixed the speaker.  ""Did he repent?"" asked one.  ""It doesn't say so,"" said the wretched Jeffreys, turning over to the next page in a miserable attempt to appear as if he was not involved in the inquiry.  ""How dreadful!"" said another.  ""Besides this, 849 people were transported.""  ""By Jeffreys, sir?""  ""Yes,"" replied the owner of the name, finally throwing off all disguise and giving himself up to his fate, ""by this wicked Jeffreys.""  ""Yes, sir; and what else did he do?""  Trimble, as he looked every now and then down the room, was astonished to notice the quiet which prevailed in the lower class, and the interest with which every boy was listening to the new master.  He did not like it.  He couldn't manage to interest his class, and it didn't please him at all that this casual newcomer should come and cut him out before his face.  After a while he walked down the room and approached the assistant's desk.  He was convinced this, unwonted order could not result from any legitimate cause.  ""You don't seem to be doing much work here, I must say,"" said he.  ""Give me the book, Mr Jeffreys: I want to see what they know of the lesson. Where's the place?""  Jeffreys handed the book, putting his finger on the place.  Trimble glanced through a paragraph or two, and then pointing to a boy, one of the least sharp in the class, said,--  ""Now, Walker, what happened after Monmouth's death?""  ""Oh, if you please, sir, a cruel judge, called Jeffreys, condemned--""  ""That will do.  You, Rosher, how many people did he condemn to death?""  ""More than three hundred, sir,"" answered Freddy promptly.  ""What for, Bacon?""  ""Because they helped Monmouth.""  Trimble felt perplexed.  He never had a class that answered like this. He tried once more.  ""Pridger, what else did he do?""  ""He had 849 transported, sir.""  Trimble shut the book.  It was beyond him.  If Pridger had said 848 or 850, he could have made something of it.  But it floored him completely to find the second class knowing the exact number of convicts in one given year of English history.  ""Don't let me catch any of you wasting your time,"" he said.  ""Farrar, what do you mean by looking about you, sir?  Stand on the form for half an hour.""  ""Farrar has been very quiet and attentive all the afternoon,"" said Jeffreys.  ""Stand on the form an hour, Farrar,"" said Trimble, with a scowl.  Jeffreys' brow darkened as he watched the little tyrant strut off to his class.  How long would he be able to keep hands off him?  The rest of the afternoon passed uneventfully.  An unconscious bond of sympathy had arisen between the new master and his pupils.  His historical importance invested him with a glamour which was nearly heroic; and his kind word on Farrar's behalf had won him an amount of confidence which was quick in showing itself.  ""We like you better than Fison, though he was nice,"" said Bacon, as the class was about to separate.  ""I hope Trimble won't send you away,"" said another.  ""I wish you'd condemn young Trimble to death, or transport him, Mr Jeffreys,"" said a third confidentially.  ""Good-bye, Mr Jeffreys,"" said Freddy, with all the confidence of an old friend.  ""Did you like that parliament cake?""  ""Awfully,"" said Jeffreys.  ""Good-bye.""  Every one insisted on shaking hands with him, greatly to his embarrassment; and a few minutes later the school was scattered, and Jeffreys was left to go over in his mind his first day's experience.  On the whole he was cheerful.  His heart warmed to these simple little fellows, who thought none the worse of him for being ugly and clumsy. With Mrs Trimble, too, he anticipated not much difficulty.  Young Trimble was a rock ahead undoubtedly, but Jeffreys would stand him as long as he could, and not anticipate the day, which he felt to be inevitable, when he would be able to stand him no longer.  ""Well, Mr Jeffreys,"" said Mrs Trimble, as the dame and her two assistants sat down to tea, ""how do you manage?""  ""Pretty well, thank you, ma'am,"" replied Jeffreys; ""they are a nice lot of little boys, and I found them very good and quiet.""  ""Of course you would, if you let them do as they like,"" said Jonah. ""You'll have to keep them in, I can tell you, if you expect to keep order.""  It did occur to Jeffreys that if they were good without being kept in, Jonah ought to be satisfied, but he was too wise to embark on a discussion with his colleague, and confined his attentions to Mrs Trimble.  The meal being ended, he said--  ""Will you excuse me, ma'am, if I go into the city for about an hour?  I have to call at the post-office for letters.""  ""Look here,"" said Jonah, ""we don't let our assistants out any time they like.  It's not usual.  They ought to stay here.  There's plenty of work to do here.""  ""It's very important for me to get the letters, Mrs Trimble,"" said Jeffreys.  ""Well, of course, this once,"" said the matron, glancing uneasily at her son; ""but, as Jonah says, we like our young men to stay in, especially at night.  We parted with Mr Fison because he was not steady.""  ""Thank you, ma'am,"" said Jeffreys; ""if the letters have come to-day I shall not have to trouble you again.  Can I do anything for you in town?""  ""That chap won't do,"" said Jonah to his mother when at last Jeffreys started on his expedition.  ""I think he will; he means well.  It wouldn't do, Jonah,"" said the good lady, ""to have all the trouble again of finding a young man.  I think Mr Jeffreys will do.""  ""I don't,"" said Jonah sulkily, taking up a newspaper.  Jeffreys meanwhile, in a strange frame of mind, hurried down to the post-office.  The day's adventures seemed like a dream to him as he walked along, and poor Forrester seemed the only reality of his life.  Would there be a letter?  And what news would it bring him?  During the last twelve hours a new hope and object in life had opened before him. But what was it worth, if, after all, at this very moment Forrester should be lying lifeless at Bolsover?  ""Have you any letter for John Jeffreys?"" he asked; but his heart beat so loud that he scarcely heard his own voice.  The man, humming cheerily to himself, took a batch of letters out of a pigeon-hole and began to turn them over.  Jeffreys watched him feverishly, and marvelled at his indifference.  ""What name did you say--Jones?""  ""No, Jeffreys--John Jeffreys.""  Again he turned over the bundle, almost carelessly.  At length he extracted a letter, which he tossed onto the counter.  ""There you are, my beauty,"" said he.  Jeffreys, heeding nothing except that it was addressed in Mr Frampton's hand, seized the missive and hastened from the office.  At the first shop window he stood and tore it open.  ""My dear Jeffreys,--I was glad to hear from you, although your letter gave me great pain.  It would have been wiser in you to return here, whatever your circumstances might be; wiser still would it have been had you never run away.  But I do not write now to reproach you.  You have suffered enough, I know.  I write to tell you of Forrester.""  Jeffreys gave a gasp for breath before he dare read on.  ""The poor fellow has made a temporary rally, but the doctors by no means consider him out of danger.  Should he recover, which I fear is hardly probable, I grieve to say the injuries he has received would leave him a cripple for life.  There is an injury to the spine and partial paralysis, which, at the best, would necessitate his lying constantly on his back, and thus being dependent entirely on others.  If he can bear it, he is to be removed to his home in a day or two.  He has asked about you, and on my telling him that I was writing to you, said, `Tell him I know it was only an accident.'  I am sure that this letter will grieve you; I wish I could say anything which will help you.  May God in His mercy bring good to us all out of this sorrow!  As for yourself, I hope that your guardian's resentment will be short-lived, and that you will let me hear of your welfare.  Count on me as a friend, in spite of all.  ""Yours always,--  ""T.  Frampton.""  ""In spite of all!"" groaned poor Jeffreys, as he crushed the letter into his pocket.  ""Will no one have pity on me?""    CHAPTER SEVEN.  WHAT A DAY FOR JONAH!  The six months which followed Jeffreys' introduction into the classical atmosphere of Galloway House passed uneventfully for him, and not altogether unpleasantly.  He had, it is true, the vision of young Forrester always in his mind, to drag him down, whenever he dwelt upon it, into the bitterest dejection; and he had the active spite and insolence of Jonah Trimble daily to try his temper and tax his patience.  Otherwise he was comfortable.  Mrs Trimble, finding him steady and quiet, treated him kindly when she had her own way, and indifferently when her son was with her.  The boys of the second class maintained the mysterious respect they had conceived for him on the day of his arrival, and gave him wonderfully little trouble or difficulty.  He had his evenings for the most part to himself, and even succeeded, after something like a battle-royal with the Trimbles, in carrying his point of having one ""evening out"" in the week.  It nearly cost him his situation, and it nearly cost Jonah a bone-shaking before the question was settled.  But Jeffreys could be stubborn when he chose, and stood out grimly on this point.  Had it not been for this weekly respite, Galloway House would have become intolerable before a month was over.  He heard occasionally from Mr Frampton; but the one question which would have interested him most was generally passed over.  Mr Frampton probably considered that any reference to Forrester would be painful to his correspondent, and therefore avoided it.  At last, however, in reply to Jeffreys' entreaty to know where the boy was and how he was progressing, the head-master wrote:--  ""I really cannot tell you what you want to know about Forrester, as I have heard nothing of him.  His father, as you know, is an officer in India, and his only relative in England was his grandmother, to whose house at Grangerham he was removed on leaving here.  The last I heard was a month after he had left here, when he was reported still to be lingering.  His grandmother, so I heard, was very ill.  He himself, as a last hope, was to be removed to a hospital (I could not hear which) to receive special treatment.  Since then--which is five months ago--I have heard nothing, and my last letter to Grangerham was returned by the Dead-Letter Office.  I wish I could tell you more.  You may depend on my doing so should I hear of him again,"" etc.  It is hardly to be wondered at after this that poor Jeffreys felt the weight upon him heavier than ever.  As long as he had known where Forrester was, and had the hope of hearing from time to time how he fared, he had been able to buoy himself up with the hope of some day making up to his victim for the injury he had inflicted; but when, suddenly, Forrester dropped hopelessly out of his life, the burden of his conscience grew intolerable.  He struggled hard, by devoting himself to his boys and by hard private study in his leisure hours, to drive the haunting memory away, but the effort succeeded only for a time.  At night, as he lay in bed, unable to escape from himself, the vision of that pale face and that cry of terror hardly once left him till merciful sleep came to his rescue.  And by day, when his small pupils vexed him, or the spiteful Jonah tempted him to revenge, the thought of Forrester cowed him into submission, and left him no choice but to endure what seemed to be his penance.  ""Ma,"" said Mrs Trimble's hopeful, one afternoon after school had closed, ""you've been nicely taken in over that Jeffreys, I can tell you.""  ""What!"" said the lady.  ""He doesn't drink, does he?""  ""Don't know.  But there's something queer about him, and I mean to find it out.  I'm not going to let it go on, I can tell you.""  ""Why, what's he been doing, Jonah?""  ""Doing?  You must go about with your eyes shut if you don't see he's been sulking ever since he came here.  I tell you there's something wrong.""  ""Oh, don't say that, Jonah.""  ""You never took a character with him, did you?""  ""No; he hadn't been in a place before.""  ""Depend on it, ma, he's skulking.  He's done something, and finds this a convenient place to hide away in.""  ""But, Jonah, he's never shown any signs of not being all right.  He's very kind to the boys, and keeps them in wonderful order, better than you do almost.""  Jonah did not like this, because he knew it was true.  His boys were neither fond of him nor obedient to his control, and the fact that Jeffreys' boys were both was additional proof that there was something wrong.  ""Do you suppose he can't manage to take you in, ma?  Of course, any one could.""  ""But he makes himself very pleasant, and studies, and keeps very quiet out of school.""  ""Of course.  Isn't that what I tell you?  He's hiding.  What do you suppose he skulks away into town for once a week--eh?""  ""Not to drink, I do hope?"" said the lady.  ""Whatever it is, I mean to get to the bottom of it, for the sake of the school,"" said Jonah.  ""Fancy the mess we'd get into if it got known we had a shady character here as a teacher!""  ""But, Jonah, dear, it's only suspicion.  He may be all right.""  ""Oh, anything _may_ be,"" retorted the philosophic Jonah.  ""The thing is--is it?""  As Mrs Trimble was unable to answer this question, she retired from the discussion, and hoped devoutly nothing was going to happen which would necessitate her doing more work about the school than she at present did.  The unconscious Jeffreys meanwhile was upstairs, washing himself before starting for his weekly ""evening out.""  He had more than usual before him on this particular evening, as, besides calling at the post-office-- an errand he never missed--he had discovered another old bookshop across the river which kept open till seven o'clock.  And after that he had promised Freddy and Teddy, with whom from the first he had kept up a warm friendship, to call up at their house and help them mend their tricycle.  With this full programme before him, he lost no time in starting on his travels; little dreaming that the quick pace at which he strode along gave unwonted exercise to Mr Jonah Trimble, who, animated by an amiable curiosity, dogged his footsteps at a respectful distance.  It was about five o'clock when Jeffreys reached the post-office.  The clerk knew him by this time, and this evening handed him a letter without being asked.  It was a short friendly line from Mr Frampton with no news--at any rate about Forrester; and Trimble, as he watched him emerge from the office, letter in hand, and haggard in face, chalked down in in his own mind a first clue as to the mystery that was exercising him.  From the post-office Jeffreys strolled leisurely down the streets toward the bridge, stopping to look into some of the shops by the way, and occasionally making Trimble's heart jump by looking behind him.  In due time he pulled up at the bookseller's shop.  Trimble saw the proprietor welcome his visitor with a nod which bespoke an acquaintance of some standing.  He saw Jeffreys turning over the contents of some of the trays, taking up a book now and then and examining it, and sometimes propping himself up against the doorpost and reading page after page. It was not very entertaining work for the spy; but curiosity is patient, and Jonah as he watched the unconscious reader at a safe distance fortified himself by the conviction that he was watching the working-out of some deep-laid plot.  Presently he saw Jeffreys disappear into the shop, and what was his amazement, when presently he ""casually"" passed the door, to see him seated with the bookseller at a table earnestly poring over and discussing a small faded sheet of paper which lay between them!  Trimble would have given worlds to know what the mysterious document was, and what villainy was brewing.  Had he known it, he might not have stood out there in the evening air quite as patiently as he did.  For the mysterious document happened to be nothing but an old tattered and torn Commonwealth tract which Jeffreys had discovered folded up between the leaves of an ancient volume of poetry, and which he and his friend the bookseller were spending a very agreeable half-hour in piecing together and deciphering.  About seven o'clock Jeffreys rose to go, pocketing the precious relic, which his friend had given him; and Trimble, having carefully noted down the name of the shop and the personal appearance of the suspicious bookseller, followed gingerly back across the bridge.  The streets were getting less crowded, and Jonah had increasing difficulty in keeping himself concealed as he crawled along on the opposite side of the way some thirty or forty yards in the rear of his man.  Just as Jeffreys was crossing the space opposite the grand front of the minster a dog sprang forward to meet him with every token of joy.  It was Julius, and Jeffreys knew that the master could not be very far away.  He turned round for a moment, as though he meditated flight, and gave Jonah a spasm by the unexpected movement.  But before he could decide Mr Halgrove strolled pleasantly round the corner, and nodded to him as if he and his ward had not parted five minutes before.  ""Ah, John, fine evening for a stroll.  On your way home?""  Mr Halgrove till that moment had not had the faintest idea that his ward was still in York.  ""No,"" said Jeffreys, patting the dog's head and looking very much the reverse of comfortable.  ""They say the front of the minster is beginning to crumble at places,"" said Mr Halgrove, looking up at the noble pile before them; ""I hope it's not true.  Are you much here?""  ""No.  I live in another part of the town.""  ""Very odd my meeting you,"" said Mr Halgrove.  ""I was thinking of you only to-day.  I had a letter from Mr Frampton.""  ""Indeed, sir--about Forrester?""  ""About--oh, your little victim?  Oddly enough, it was not.  It was to remind me that your last half-term's fees were not paid.  Don't you think it would be judicious to clear up this little score?  Looks bad, you know--to run away with score against you.""  Jeffrey's face turned pale.  He had at least supposed that up to the time of his expulsion from his guardian's house Mr Halgrove would have considered himself responsible for his maintenance.  ""I never dreamt,"" he faltered.  ""How much is it?""  ""Quite a little sum, isn't it?  Come, you were last at school.  Too bad to pose me with compound division at my time of life.  Half a term at 40 a year?""  ""Seven pounds!"" gasped Jeffreys.  ""Not quite, 6 13 shillings, 4 pence.  Fancy my being better at mental arithmetic than you!""  ""I haven't got any money.  I only get a pound a month and my board.""  ""My dear boy, I congratulate you.  Twelve pounds a year!  Now, wasn't it a pity you didn't take that 5 note I offered you?  Suppose you take it now!""  Mr Halgrove put his hand to his pocket and took out his purse.  ""No!"" exclaimed Jeffreys, in a tone that made Trimble, who was busy engaged in inspecting the architecture of the minster from behind a deep buttress close to the speaker, jump--""I'd sooner die!""  ""Don't do that, my dear fellow, don't do that,"" said Mr Halgrove, with a smile which belied the anger he felt at the refusal; ""rather than that I'll keep the money.  I have no wish to commit a murder.  It's not in my line.  That's one point in which you and I differ, isn't it?""  Jeffreys made as though he would spring upon him.  What was it checked him?  Was it the solemn minster--was it a dread of his guardian's superior strength--was it fear of punishment?  Or was it a momentary glimpse of a pale face in a moonlit room far away, which took the spirit out of him and made his arm drop at his side?  ""Well, I won't keep you,"" said Mr Halgrove, who had also for a moment looked uneasy.  ""I dare say you are in a hurry like myself.  The fact is, I am going a trip to America next week and have a good deal to attend to.  That makes me doubly glad to have met you.  Good-bye, my dear boy, good-bye.  Come, Julius.""  Julius as he slunk off at his master's heels, and heard the smothered oath which escaped Mr Halgrove's lips as soon as he found himself alone, looked round wistfully and pitifully, and wished he were allowed to go where he pleased.  Jeffreys walked on like a man in a dream.  For six months he had been working out what had been to him a penance, hoping to live down his bad name, even if he could never win a good.  But now in a moment it seemed as if the labour of those patient months had been dashed to the ground, and his guardian's bitter words branded themselves on his heart as he paced on out of the shadow of the noble minster into the dusk of the city.  Trimble, nearly bursting with excitement--for he had overheard all the latter part of the conversation--crept after him.  What a time he was having!  Jeffreys bent his steps almost aimlessly out of the city into the country beyond.  It was only half-past seven, and Teddy and Freddy were expecting him.  He had not the heart to fail them, though he would gladly have remained solitary that evening.  The Roshers lived in a small cottage some distance down the lane in which six months ago Jeffreys had first encountered the sunshine of their presence.  How long ago it seemed now!  Ah! that was the very bank on which he sat; and there beyond was the railway embankment at which the navvies were working, now finished and with the grass growing up its sides.  Trimble's little heart jumped to his mouth as he saw the man he was following stop abruptly and begin to climb the bank.  He was too close behind to be able to turn back.  All he could do was to crouch down in the ditch and ""lie low.""  He heard Jeffreys as he gained the top of the bank sigh wearily; then he seemed to be moving as if in search of a particular spot; and then the lurker's hair stood on end as he heard the words, hoarsely spoken,--  ""It was this very place.""  What a day Jonah was having!  After a quarter of an hour's pause, during which the patient Jonah got nearly soaked to the skin in his watery hiding-place, Jeffreys roused himself and descended into the lane.  Any one less abstracted could not have failed to detect the scared face of the spy shining out like a white rag from the hedge.  But Jeffreys heeded nothing and strode on to Ash Cottage.  Long before he got there, Freddy and Teddy, who had been on the look-out for him for an hour, scampered down to meet him.  ""Hurrah, Jeff!"" shouted Teddy (I grieve to say that these irreverent brethren had long ago fallen into the scandalous habit of calling their teacher by a familiar contraction of his proper name, nor had the master rebuked them).  ""Hurrah, Jeff! we were afraid you weren't coming.""  ""The tricycle won't go,"" said Freddy; ""we've pulled it all to bits, and tried to make it right with a hammer, but it's very bad.""  ""It's glorious you've come to do it.  Isn't Jeff a brick, Teddy?""  ""Rather--and, oh, did you bring any oil?  We used all ours up.""  ""We've got a screw-driver, though!"" said Freddy.  ""And lots of string!"" shouted Teddy.  ""You _are_ a brick to come and do it,"" shouted both.  Where in the world is there a tonic equal to the laugh of a light- hearted grateful little boy?  How could Jeffreys help forgetting his trouble for a time and devoting himself heart and soul to the business of that tricycle?  Trimble, as he dodged along after them perplexed and puffing, could hardly believe his eyes as he saw his morose colleague suddenly throw off the burden that was on him and become gay.  ""Come along, little chaps--let's see what we can do,"" said Jeffreys, as the three strode out to the cottage.  ""Where is he?""  ""In the shed.  We've got a candle.""  Trimble saw them disappear into the garden, and, guided by their cheery voices, soon discovered the back of the shed in which the momentous surgical operation was to take place.  It backed on the road, and might have been built for Trimble's purpose.  For the woodwork abounded in most convenient cracks, through which a spy might peep and listen luxuriously.  What a day Jonah was having!  The Roshers conducted their friend into the place like anxious relatives who conduct a physician into a sick-chamber.  The poor patient lay on the floor in a very bad way.  Two wheels were off, the axle was bent, the wire spokes were twisted, the saddle was off, and the brake was all over the place.  Jeffreys shook his head and looked grave.  ""It's a bad job,"" said he.  ""You see, we were giving mother a ride on it, and she's too heavy-- especially going downhill.  She thought we were holding it, but it got away.  We yelled to her to put on the brake, but she didn't, and it went bang into the wall.""  ""And your mother?"" inquired Jeffreys, somewhat anxiously.  ""Oh, her face is much better now.  The doctor says there'll be hardly any marks left after all.""  It was a long business putting the unlucky tricycle in order.  Jeffreys was not a mechanic.  All he could do was to put the parts together in a makeshift way, and by straightening some of the bent parts and greasing some of the stiff parts restore the iron horse into a gloomy semblance of his old self.  The boys were as grateful and delighted as if he had constructed a new machine out of space; and when at last a trial trip demonstrated that at any rate the wheels would go round and the saddle would carry them, their hearts overflowed.  ""You are a real brick, Jeff,"" said Teddy; ""I wish I could give you a hundred pounds!""  ""I don't want a hundred pounds,"" said Jeffreys, with a smile; ""if you and Freddy and I are good friends, that's worth a lot more to me.""  ""Why?"" demanded Freddy; ""are we the only friends you've got?""  Jeffreys looked out of the window and said,--  ""Not quite--I've got one more.""  ""Who--God?"" asked the boy naturally.  Poor Jeffreys!  He sometimes forgot that Friend, and it startled and humbled him to hear the little fellow's simple question.  ""Of course, he's got Him,"" interposed Teddy, without giving him time to reply.  ""But who else, Jeff?""  ""I saw him not long ago,"" said Jeffreys.  ""His name's Julius.""  ""You don't like him more than us, do you?"" asked Teddy rather anxiously.  ""Not a quarter as much, old chap,"" said Jeffreys.  There was a pause, during which Trimble chuckled to think how little the speaker guessed into whose ears he was betraying the name of his villainous accomplice!  Presently, however, he started to hear the sound of his own name.  ""Jeff,"" said Teddy, ""isn't Mr Trimble a beast?""  ""Let's talk about something pleasant,"" suggested Jeffreys, by way of begging the question.  ""Let's talk about hanging him; that would be pleasant,"" said Teddy.  ""Would you be sorry if he was dead?"" demanded Teddy, in his matter-of- fact way.  ""I say, Jeff, wouldn't it be jolly if we could kill everybody we hated?""  ""Wouldn't it be jolly if every little boy who talked like a little donkey were to have his ears boxed?"" said Jeffreys.  ""I wish he'd been on the tricycle instead of mother,"" continued Teddy, with a sigh of content at the bare idea.  ""Teddy, you are not as nice a little boy as I thought when you talk like that,"" said Jeffreys.  ""Come and let's have one more turn on the machine, and then I must hurry back, or Mrs Trimble will think I'm lost.""  Jeffreys got back to Galloway House about ten o'clock, and found Jonah sitting up for him.  ""So you _have_ come back,"" said that individual pompously.  ""I hope you've enjoyed your evening out.""  ""Yes,"" said Jeffreys, ""pretty well.""  ""Oh!"" said Jonah to himself, as he went up to bed, bursting with excitement.  ""If he only knew what I know!  Let me see--""  And then he went over in his mind the events of that wonderful evening, the visit to the post-office and the horrified look as he came out letter in hand; the mysterious conference with the bookseller, doubtless over this very letter.  And how artfully he had been pretending to look at the books outside till he saw no one was looking!  Then, the secret meeting with his accomplice in the minster yard--Mr Julius, yes, that was the name he had himself told the boys--and the altercation over the money, doubtless the booty of their crime, and Mr Julius's denunciation of Jeffreys as a murderer!  Whew!  Then that lonely country walk, and that search on the bank, and that exclamation, ""It was this very place!"" Whew!  Jonah had tied a bit of his bootlace on the hedge just under the spot, and could find it again within a foot.  Then the rencontre with the two boys and the strange, enigmatical talk in the shed, pointing to the plot of a new crime of which he--Trimble--was to be the victim.  Ha, ha!--and the business over that tricycle too, in the candle-light. Jonah could see through that.  He could put a spoke in a wheel as well as Jeffreys.  Two things were plain.  He must get hold of the letter; and he must visit the scene of the crime _with a spade_!  Then--  Jonah sat up half the night thinking of it, till at last the deep breathing of his colleague in the next room reminded him that now at any rate was the time to get the letter.  He had seen Jeffreys crush it into his side pocket after leaving the bookseller's and he had heard him before getting into bed just now hang his coat on the peg behind the door.  And it was hot, and the door was open.  What a day Jonah was having!  Fortune favours the brave.  It was a work of two minutes only.  The pocket was there at his hand before he had so much as put a foot in the room.  And there was the letter--two letters--and not a board creaked or a footstep sounded before he was safe back in his own room with the documentary evidence before him.  There was only one letter after all.  The other paper was a rubbishing rigmarole about General Monk and the Parliament 1660.  This Jonah tossed contemptuously into the grate.  But the other letter, how his flesh crept as he read it!  It had no date, and was signed only in initials.  ""Dear J.  There is no news.  I can understand your trouble and remorse, and this uncertainty makes it all the more terrible to you.  I know it is vain to say to you, `Forget,' but do not write about poor Forrester's blood being on your head!  Your duty is to live and redeem the past. Let the dead bury their dead, dear fellow, and turn your eyes forward, like a brave man.  Yours ever, J.F.""  Do you wonder if Jonah's blood curdled in his veins--""remorse,"" ""uncertainty,"" ""poor Forrester,"" ""his blood on your head,"" eh? ""bury your dead""!  Whew!  _What_ a day Jonah had had, to be sure!    CHAPTER EIGHT.  I KNOW A BANK.  Jonah Trimble may not have been a genius of the first water, but he was at least wise enough to know that he could not both have his cake and eat it.  His discovery of Jeffreys' villainy was a most appetising cake, and it wanted some little self-denial to keep his own counsel about it, and not spoil sport by springing his mine until all the trains were laid.  Another consideration, moreover, which prevented his taking immediate action was that Jeffreys was extremely useful at Galloway House, and could not be spared just yet--even to the gallows.  In a few months' time, when the good name of the school, which had rapidly risen since he came upon the scene, was well established, things might be brought to a climax.  Meanwhile Jonah Trimble would keep his eye on his man, read his _Eugene Aram_, and follow up his clues.  Jeffreys awoke on the following morning with a feeling of oppression on his mind which for a little time he could not define.  It was not his guardian's words, bitter as they had been; it was not the insolence of his fellow-usher, intolerable as that was becoming.  When at last his wandering thoughts came in and gave the trouble shape, he found it took a much more practical form.  He was in debt seven pounds to Mr Frampton.  It never occurred to him to wonder whether Mr Halgrove had been telling him the truth or not, nor to his unbusinesslike mind did it occur that his guardian, as the trustee responsible for what money he once had, was liable for the debt, however much he might like to repudiate it.  No; all he knew was that Mr Frampton was owed seven pounds, and that he himself had nothing, or next to nothing, to pay.  By hard saving during the six months he had managed to save a sovereign, but of this only last week he had spent the greater part in boots and clothing.  Now his worldly wealth consisted of four shillings!  He was down early that morning, and was relieved to find that Mrs Trimble was in the parlour alone, without her son.  The good lady was in an amiable mood.  The school was getting on, and something told her that it was not greatly due either to her own exertions or the influence of Jonah.  Therefore, being a mathematical old lady, she subtracted herself and Jonah from the present school staff, and came to the conclusion that Jeffreys must have had a hand in the improvement.  ""Young man,"" said she, in reply to her assistant's greeting, ""you've been with me six months.  Are you comfortable?""  ""Pretty well,"" said Jeffreys.  ""I'm very fond of my boys, and I always get on comfortably with you.""  The mathematical dame once more went to work, and answered, ""You and Jonah don't hit it, I suppose.  You don't know Jonah, young man.  He may not be easily satisfied, but he's a gentleman.""  ""I'm sure,"" said Jeffreys, to whom this tribute seemed the last he should expect to hear bestowed on his amiable fellow-usher, ""I try to get on with him, and shall go on trying.""  ""That's right,"" said Mrs Trimble, once more shuddering at the prospect of being left short-handed.  ""What I was going to say to you was, that now you've been here six months, and are not a forward young man, and don't drink, I shall raise your wages, and give you thirty shillings a month instead of twenty.  How will that suit you?""  ""You are very kind,"" said the grateful Jeffreys, with a tremble in his voice which quite moved the old lady's heart; ""it will be very acceptable.""  ""Very good.  You need not mention it to Jonah,"" added she hurriedly, as that young gentleman's footsteps were heard that moment on the stairs.  The only difference which the unconscious Jeffreys was aware of in the conduct of Jonah Trimble towards himself was that the young gentleman was a trifle more hectoring and a trifle more facetious than before.  But even to the little mind of Jonah Trimble it had been revealed that at present it would be extremely awkward for Galloway House if Jeffreys went ""on strike.""  He was a good teacher and manager; and his boys were devoted to him.  Of course, when a boy goes home from school full of the praises of his teacher, his parents are pleased too, and think well of the school, and tell their friends what a nice place it is for boys, and so on.  It is a good advertisement, in fact.  Besides, with Mrs Trimble so lazy, and Jonah himself so unattractive, it would involve a great deal of trouble all round if Jeffreys deserted it.  They knew by experience that young fellows of good education did not as a rule jump at the situation of second usher in Galloway House.  And they knew, also, something of the horrors of a prolonged vacancy in their staff.  Jonah was rather relieved when Jeffreys, immediately after school, shut himself up in his own room, and remained there studying for the rest of the evening.  The proceeding favoured a little idea of his own, which was to revisit the spot where he had tied his bootlace the evening before, and see if an examination of that fatal spot would throw any fresh light on his investigation.  Accordingly after tea he sallied forth with a trowel in his coat pocket.  It was rather a dismal expedition, for it rained, and there was a cool breeze.  The lane was muddy even in the roadway, and on the banks it was a quagmire.  Still Jonah was too full of his mystery seriously to mind the weather.  He trudged up and down the lane, sharply scrutinising the hedge for his bootlace.  For a long time his perseverance was unrewarded.  At length, however, his eye detected the welcome flutter of a bright tag among the leaves, and he recognised the scene of last night's damp sojourn.  He clambered up onto the bank, regardless of his garments, and commenced an anxious scrutiny.  The bank itself showed no signs of a ""mystery."" Even the traces of Jeffreys' visit to it the night before were obliterated by the soaking rain.  The field on the other side was equally unsuggestive.  Jonah trampled around in circles on the young corn, but never a pistol, or a rusty knife, or a bottle of poison, did he discover.  Yet he had heard the villain say distinctly,--  ""This was the very place!""  He scrambled back rather crestfallen on to the bank.  It was getting dark, and the rain came down ceaselessly, yet so strong was his certainty that here he should discover the evidence he was looking for, that for another half-hour he plied his trowel diligently.  Sometimes when it struck on a stone or the roots of a bramble, he trembled with anticipation; and once, when, groping under a hedge, his hand suddenly encountered a dead rat, his hair literally stood on end.  He began to get nervous and uncomfortable.  The night became suddenly dark, and the wind whistled all sorts of weird tunes among the trees. Jonah did not exactly believe in ghosts; still, if there were such things, this was just the night and just the place for the ghost he was looking for to take its walk abroad.  He did not like it, and began to wish he was safe at home.  The bushes round him began to rustle noisily, and a gate in the field swung to and fro with an almost human groan.  He fancied he could descry wandering lights and white gleams in the darkness, and the vague consciousness of something coming nearer and nearer.  At last, with a great effort, he roused himself from his moist seat, and leaped down from the bank into the lane.  The instant his feet touched the road he was conscious of a low growl, and next moment found himself pinned, with his back to the bank, by a furious dog.  His yell of terror had mingled with the wind for a couple of minutes before he became aware of the red glow of a cigar in front of him, and behind that the dim countenance of the man whose talk with Jeffreys he had overheard the previous evening.  ""Oh, Mr Julius!"" he howled; ""help me.  Call him off; I shall be torn to pieces.""  ""And pray how come you to know the name of my dog?"" said Mr Halgrove; ""eh, my little highwayman?""  ""Please, sir, I'm not a highwayman.  I was only looking for something on the bank.  Oh, Mr Julius!""  ""My dog is not used to be called Mr,"" replied Mr Halgrove.  ""Oh, I--I thought that was your name,"" whimpered Jonah, not daring to stir an inch for fear of incurring the resentment of the dog.  ""And pray how came you to think my name was Julius?"" said Mr Halgrove, becoming interested.  ""Oh! please sir, wasn't it you that was talking to Jeffreys last night in the minster yard?""  It was too dark for Jonah to see Mr Halgrove's eyebrows go up at this unexpected question.  ""Julius, come in, sir.  So you know the gentleman I was speaking to yesterday,"" said he, coolly.  ""What did you say his name was?""  ""Jeffreys, sir.  He's an--""  Jonah pulled up.  This man, whatever his name was, was Jeffreys' accomplice.  Jonah felt he must not commit himself.  ""I beg your pardon,"" said Mr Halgrove, noticing the abrupt pause.  ""I am saying--it's--it's rather a wet night, sir,"" said Jonah, making a move to walk on.  Mr Halgrove snapped his fingers to Julius, and next instant the wretched Jonah was pinned again to the bank.  ""What did you say he was?"" asked Mr Halgrove, lighting a fusee.  ""Oh, please, sir, please call him off.  My assistant, sir.""  ""Oh! your assistant--in what?  Highway robbery?""  ""No, sir.  In teaching a school.  Please, sir, call him off.""  Mr Halgrove paid no heed to the entreaty, but proceeded to extract numerous particulars as to his ward's conduct and mode of life at Galloway House.  ""So he's taken to minding little boys, has he? and you are his employer? You are aware that you have a treasure of course?""  Even Trimble was not so dense as to miss the sneer with which the inquiry was made.  It emboldened him considerably.  ""I dislike him; so does ma.  We consider him a dangerous character.""  Mr Halgrove laughed.  ""What makes you think that?""  ""There's a--oh, sir, please call off the dog--mystery about him. He's--""  ""Is that the reason you spied on him yesterday?""  ""No, sir--that is--"" for at that moment Julius growled--""yes, sir.  I thought if there was anything wrong it was my duty to the school to know it, sir.""  ""Exemplary pedagogue!  And now you know it?  Eh?""  ""Well, sir, I have my suspicions.""  ""No!  And what might your suspicions be?""  ""Oh, sir,"" replied the wretched Jonah, feeling like a blue-bottle on a pin, ""I believe he's a murderer in hiding.  I really do.""  ""Clever little ferret!  You've found that out, have you?""  ""I feel no doubt about it,"" said Jonah, plucking up a little confidence.  ""Don't feel any.  When and where did the interesting event take place?""  ""Oh, you could tell me that better than I can tell you,"" stammered Trimble.  ""Indeed!"" said Mr Halgrove, his eyebrows going up ominously in the dark.  ""Of course I shouldn't--that is--I should never dream of getting _you_ into trouble, sir.""  Mr Halgrove took his cigar out of his mouth and stared at the speaker.  ""I'd wait till you were safe away in America, sir; and even then I wouldn't let your name be known, you know, as an accomplice.""  Mr Halgrove put his cigar back into his mouth, and changed his cane from his left hand to his right.  ""Fetch him here, Julius,"" said he, stepping back into the middle of the road.  It was in vain the wretched Jonah howled and called for mercy.  ""So you won't let my name be known as an accomplice!  How very kind!""  And he gave practical proof of his gratitude by caning Jonah till both were tired.  ""Now good-night,"" said Mr Halgrove when he had done, ""and thank you for a pleasant evening.  I dare say Mr Jeffreys will make up for any little deficiencies on my part if you ask him.  Ask him, with my compliments, to show you the little game he played with one of his old school- fellows.  Good-night, Mr Trimble.  Wish him good-night, Julius.""  Julius once more pinned his affrighted victim to the bank, and then following at his master's heels, left the bruised and bewildered Jonah to limp home as best he could.  The day he had had yesterday had been nothing in comparison with to-day! In the school, meanwhile, there was jubilation and thanksgiving over the fact that Jonah had a bad headache.  Jeffreys, with the first and second classes merged for the occasion into one, amazed Mrs Trimble by the order and industry which he commanded.  ""The young man's worth his money,"" said the good lady, with a sigh of relief, for she had counted on losing her nap for that day at least, and was grateful beyond measure to find her fears disappointed.  As for the first class, they got completely spoiled by their day's change of teacher, and vowed they would all become dunces in order to be put back in the second class.  ""I say, Jeff,"" said Teddy confidentially, as the school was being dismissed, ""_is_ there any chance of his dying?  It's been so ripping to-day without him.""  ""Hold your tongue, sir,"" said Jeffreys, in a tone which astonished his bloodthirsty young confidant; ""you're old enough to know better than talk like that.""  Teddy looked very miserable at this rebuke.  ""Don't be in a wax with me, Jeff,"" he said appealingly.  ""Whatever would I do if you got to hate me?""  Jeffreys was not proof against this, and walked home with his two young friends, beguiling the way with cheery talk, which effectually dispelled the cloud which his passing anger had roused.  On his way back he felt impelled to climb for a moment on the bank at his favourite spot.  It amazed him to see the ground all torn up, and to find a trowel lying half bedded in the turf at the top.  Still more did it surprise and perplex him to find a penknife, which he recognised at once as belonging to Trimble, and which he distinctly recollected having seen in that hero's hand during school the afternoon of the preceding day.  What did it all mean?    CHAPTER NINE.  A THUNDERSTORM.  It did not add to Jonah's happiness to see the looks of evident disgust with which the first class greeted his reappearance in the schoolroom. Their pleasant experience yesterday had demoralised them, and they settled down listlessly at Jonah's bidding like voyagers who, after a day in still waters, put out once more to the rough sea.  Teddy especially felt the hardships of the mighty deep.  Jonah's eye transfixed him all day.  If he spoke, if he fidgeted, if he looked about, the hand of the tyrant swooped down upon him.  He spent the greater part of the day standing on the form.  The contents of his pockets (including some priceless marbles) were impounded; he had two columns of dates to commit to memory before he could go home; and, hardest of all, because of a little blot, he was reduced to the ineffable humiliation of writing all his exercises on a slate!  It took all the big heart of the little fellow to bear up against this mountain of calamity, and had it not been for an occasional glimpse of Jeffreys' face, turned sympathetically in his direction, his courage might have failed him.  School closed, and still his dates were unlearnt.  His legs ached with standing hour after hour on the narrow form, and his head, lifted three feet higher than usual into the heated atmosphere of the room, swam ominously.  Freddy, after waiting about dismally for half an hour, had gone home alone.  The voices of boys remaining to play or talk in the yard outside had one after another ceased.  Jeffreys had long since taken himself and his books elsewhere, and only Jonah was left to keep watch over his prisoner.  The boy made a tremendous effort to master the dates, but they went through him like water through a sieve.  He could not even keep his eyes on the book, and when he turned them towards the master's desk, Jonah seemed to be half hidden in mist.  He edged cautiously to the end of the form nearest the wall, where at least he might get a little support.  It was a perilous voyage, for he was two feet away, and scarcely dare move at a greater rate than an inch a minute.  He got there at last, nearly done up, and with a sigh of relief leaned his head against the cold plaster.  ""Rosher, stand at the other end of the form immediately, and learn twenty more dates for being idle.""  Alas poor Teddy!  He had held out long, and braved much.  But his heart quailed now.  He seemed glued to the wall, and the form all of a sudden seemed to contract into a tight-rope over a chasm.  ""I'm so tired, sir, I--""  ""Silence, sir! and do what you're told,"" thundered Jonah.  Teddy staggered forward half a step, but shrank back before he had finished it to the friendly wall.  Trimble rose from his seat.  ""Do you hear me?"" he shouted furiously.  ""Stand where I tell you.""  ""Please, sir, I can't.  I--""  Here Trimble advanced towards him, and Teddy, fairly unnerved and almost fainting, slipped down from the bench and burst into tears.  ""That's it, is it?"" said Jonah; ""we'll see whether you can or--""  At that instant the door opened, and Jeffreys entered the room.  It did not require the boy's sobbing appeal, ""Oh, Jeff, Jeff!"" to enable him to take in the situation at a glance.  Nor did it need a second glance at the face of the intruder to induce Jonah to turn pale.  Jeffreys advanced without a word to the form, brushing Jonah out of his way with a swing that sent him staggering six paces down the floor, and putting his arm round Teddy, led him without a word from the room.  ""Come along, little chap,"" said he, when they got outside; ""come home.""  The sound of his voice revived Teddy like a cordial.  ""Do you hate me for blubbering?"" he asked anxiously; ""wasn't it like a baby?""  ""How long had you been up there?"" asked Jeffreys.  ""It was half-past one when he stood me up.  I had only just been looking round to see where Freddy was; and oh, Jeff, I've got to write on a slate just because of a little blot.  What's the time now?""  ""Half-past five,"" said Jeffreys, putting on his hat, and swinging Teddy's satchel over his own arm.  ""Are you coming with me Jeff?"" asked the boy eagerly.  ""Of course you couldn't get home alone.""  Great was the content of the little fellow as he left Galloway House with his hand on the strong arm of his tutor.  Greater still were his surprise and content when, as soon as the streets were past, Jeffreys took him up on his back and carried him the rest of the way to Ash Cottage.  ""Thanks, awfully, old Jeff,"" said the boy, as they parted at the gate of the cottage.  ""What makes you so kind to Freddy and me?""  ""I'm not good at riddles, Teddy.  Good-night,"" and he went.  Jonah, as he was not surprised to find, was expecting him, in a state of high ferment.  Jeffreys would fain have avoided an interview.  For he was constantly discovering that he was still far from sure of himself. That afternoon his passion had been within an ace of mastering him; and at any time he dreaded something might happen which would undo all the penance of those last six months.  He therefore resolved wisely in the present instance to avoid altercation as far as possible.  ""Well, sir, and what have you got to say for yourself?  Where have you been?"" demanded Jonah, in tones of lofty bitterness.  ""I have just taken Rosher home.  After standing four hours on the form he wasn't fit to walk himself.""  ""Oh!"" snorted Jonah, nearly bursting with indignation; ""and pray how--""  ""Excuse me, Trimble.  If you and Mrs Trimble wish me to leave, I'll do so.  If not, don't talk to me.  I don't want it.""  Poor Jonah nearly had a fit.  He, head man of Galloway House, knowing what he did, to be spoken to like this by a stuck-up--murderer!  He had prepared a scene, and had counted on coming to an understanding then and there.  And lo and behold! before he had well opened his mouth, he had been ordered to shut it by the very being whom he had at his mercy.  It passed Jonah's comprehension.  Jeffreys waited a minute to give him a chance of accepting his former alternative.  Then, concluding he had decided on the latter, he betook himself to his own room and remained there.  Jonah, as soon as he could recover himself sufficiently to think at all, made up his mind that, come what would, he had had enough of this sort of life.  With which conviction he crushed his hat on his head, and sallied forth into the open air.  His feet almost instinctively turned in the direction of Ash Lane; but on this occasion they went past the fatal bank and brought their owner to a halt at the door of Ash Cottage.  ""Is Mr Rosher at home?"" inquired he of the servant.  Mr Rosher was at home--a jovial, well-to-do farmer, with a hearty Yorkshire voice and a good-humoured grin on his broad face.  ""Well, lad, what is't?"" he asked, as Trimble, hat in hand, was shown into the little parlour.  ""Man, it's the little school-maister.""  ""Yes, Mr Rosher,"" said Trimble; ""I should like five minutes' talk with you if you can spare the time.""  ""Blaze away, lad.  A've nothin' else to do.""  ""I'm rather anxious about your two dear little boys,"" began Trimble.  ""Thee needn't be that; they're tight lads, and learn quite fast enough.""  ""It's not that, Mr Rosher, though I hope they do justice to the pains we take with them.""  ""They nearly killed their mother t'other day on the tricycle,"" said Mr Rosher, laughing like a young bull.  ""Was't thee or t'other young chap came to mend t'auld bone-shaker?  Twas a kindly turn to the little fellows, and I'm sorry thee didn't stay to tea, lad.""  ""We always like to try to make them happy,"" said Jonah.  ""Indeed, that is what I came to see you about.  I'm sorry to say--""  ""Thee's come to tell me why Teddy was blubbering when he got home. Thee'd better tell that to his mother,"" said the father.  ""I'm so sorry to say,"" pursued Jonah, beginning to wish he was over his task, ""my assistant-master is disappointing me.  I took him on half in charity six months ago, but lately he has been having a bad influence in the school, and I thought it, my duty--""  ""Tut, tut!  The lads have been cheerier this last six months than ever before--""  ""Of course we try all we can to make them happy, and shield them from harm,"" pursued Trimble, ""and I am glad you think we have made school happy for them--""  ""And is that all thee's come to say?"" said the bewildered parent.  ""No, sir.  Of course in school I can look after the boys and see they come to no harm; but after school hours of course they are out of my control, and then it is I'm afraid of their coming to mischief.  My assistant, I hear, has been in the habit of walking home with them, and from what I know of him he is not a desirable companion for them, and I think it is my duty to put you on your guard, Mr Rosher.  They should not be encouraged to see too much of him out of doors or bring him to the house.""  ""It bothers me why you keep the man if he's that sort!"" said Mr Rosher. ""What's wrong with him?""  ""I'm afraid he's a bad character.  I have only discovered it lately, and intend to dismiss him as soon as I get a new assistant.""  ""What dost mean by a bad character?  Is he a thief?""  Trimble looked very grave.  ""I wish it was no worse than that.""  The farmer's jaw dropped.  ""What?"" said he.  ""Dost mean to tell me the man's a murderer?""  Jonah looked terribly shocked.  ""It's a dreadful thing to suspect any one,"" said he, ""but it would not be right of me to let things go on without warning you.  I shall keep your boys under my own eyes all school-time; and I advise you--""  ""I don't want thy advice.  Take thyself off!""  Jonah saw that to prolong the interview would only make matters worse. The good father was evidently roused; but whether against him, Jonah, or against Jeffreys, he could scarcely tell.  He departed decidedly crestfallen, and more than half repenting of his amiable expedition.  His misgivings were somewhat relieved next morning when Freddy and Teddy put in an appearance punctually at school-time.  Jonah considered it expedient under the circumstances not to refer to Teddy's mutinous conduct on the preceding day--a determination which afforded great comfort to that young gentleman and which he put down by a mysterious process of reasoning to Jeffreys' good offices on his behalf.  Jonah, however, on this particular morning felt far from comfortable. It may have been the hot sultry day, or it may have been the general oppression of his own feelings, which gave him a sense of something-- probably a thunderstorm impending.  His class remarked that he was less exacting than usual, and even Jeffreys became aware that his colleague for once in a way was not himself.  The clock had just struck twelve, and the boys were beginning to look forward to their usual break in half an hour's time, when the schoolroom door suddenly opened, and disclosed the broad figure of Mr Rosher, followed at a timid distance by Mrs Trimble.  Jonah's face turned pale; Freddy and Teddy opened their eyes to their widest.  Jeffreys, on hearing Freddy mutter ""Father,"" looked round curiously, to get a view of the father of his little friends.  Mr Rosher recognised Trimble with a nod.  ""I've coom, you see, lad.  I want to have a look at this murderer fellow thee was talking about.  Where is he?""  It was a thunderclap with a vengeance!  Only two persons in the room guessed all it meant.  ""Coom, trot him out, man,"" repeated the farmer, noticing the hesitation in Jonah's scared face.  ""Is that the chap yonder thee was telling me of?"" added he, pointing to Jeffreys.  It was all up with Galloway House, and Jonah knew it.  ""Yes,"" said he.  Jeffrey's face became livid as he sprang to his feet.  ""Stay where thou art,"" said the brawny farmer, motioning him back. ""Let's have a look at thee.  So thee's a manslayer?  Thou looks it.""  A terrible pause followed--the pause of a man who struggles for words that will not come.  He looked terrible indeed; with heaving chest and bloodless lips, and eyes like the eyes of a hunted wolf.  At length he gasped--  ""Liar!"" and advanced towards the affrighted Jonah.  But the sturdy Yorkshire-man stepped between.  ""Nay, nay,"" said he, ""one's enough.  Stay where thou art, and let him give chapter and verse--chapter and verse.  He came to me last night, and said thou wast a murderer, and I've coom to see if thou art.  Thou looks one, but maybe thou'rt right to call him a liar.""  ""Ask him,"" gasped Jonah, ""what he did to his old schoolfellow, young Forrester, and then lot him call me a liar if he likes.""  ""Dost hear, lad?  What was it thee did to thy old schoolfellow young Forrester?  That's a fair question.  Out with it.""  If Jeffreys had looked terrible a moment ago, he looked still more terrible now, as he sank with a groan onto the bench, and turned a sickened look on his accuser.  The dead silence of the room almost stunned him.  He seemed to feel every eye that turned to him like a dagger in his heart, and there rose up in his mind a vision of that football field far away, and the senseless figure of the boy who lay there.  Everything came back.  The howl of execration, the frightened faces, the cap lying where the boy had flung it, even the chill autumn breeze in his face.  He knew not how long he sat there stupefied.  The voice of Mr Rosher roused him.  ""Coom, now, dost thou say liar still?""  Jeffreys struggled to his feet, no longer furious, but still more terrible in his dejection.  ""Yes,"" snapped Jonah, astonished at the effect of his accusation, and just wise enough to see that to add to or take away from the story would be to spoil it.  ""What did you do to your poor schoolfellow, young Forrester?  Do you suppose we don't see through you?""  ""Hold thy tongue, little donkey!"" said the farmer; ""let's hear what he has to say.""  For a moment it seemed as if Jeffreys was about to take him at his word, and say something.  But his tongue failed him at the critical moment, and he gave it up.  He had caught sight of Teddy's eyes fixed on his in mingled misery and terror, and the sight unmanned him.  He moved slowly to the door.  They watched him, spellbound, and in a moment he would have gone, had not Teddy with a big sob made a spring forward and seized him by the arm.  ""Oh, Jeff it's a wicked he; we don't believe it.  Freddy, we don't believe it, do we?  Father, he's been good to us; he never did anything unkind.  Don't have him sent away!""  This appeal fairly broke the spell.  Freddy was at his brother's side in an instant, and the rest of the school, had not Mr Rosher motioned them back, would have followed him.  ""Teddy and Freddy, my lads,"" said the farmer, ""go to thy seats like good lads.  Let him say yea or nay to what this--little--peacher says.""  ""Say you didn't, Jeff,"" implored the boys.  Jeffreys shook his head sadly.  ""I can't,"" he said.  ""If he's dead--""  ""Oh, he's dead,"" put in Jonah; ""I can tell you that.""  Jeffreys gave one scared look at the speaker, and then hurried from the room.  Mrs Trimble followed him up to his room.  ""I don't believe it all,"" said she; ""you never did it on purpose, you're not so bad as that.  I won't believe it even if you tell me,"" said the good lady, bursting into tears.  Jeffreys put together his few books and garments.  ""You're going,"" said she, ""of course.  It's no use hoping you won't. Here's two pounds you're owed--and--""  Jeffreys took the money, and kept her hand for a moment in his.  ""You are kind,"" said he hoarsely.  ""Good-bye, Mrs Trimble.""  He kissed her hand and took up his bundle.  At the foot of the stairs a boy's hand was laid on his arm.  ""Oh, Jeff,"" whispered Teddy--he had stolen out of the schoolroom.  ""Poor Jeff!  I know you aren't wicked.  Say good-bye, Jeff.  What shall we do? What shall we do?""  ""Good-bye, little chap,"" said Jeffreys, stooping down and kissing the boy's wet cheek.  ""But, Jeff, where are you going?  When will you--?""  Jeffreys was gone.  In the schoolroom meanwhile the inevitable reaction had taken place.  As the door closed behind Jeffreys, Jonah, hardly knowing what he did, gave vent to a hysterical laugh.  It was the signal for an explosion such as he had little counted on.  ""Thou little dirty toad!"" said the farmer, rounding on him wrathfully; ""what dost mean by that?  Hey?  For shame!""  ""Beast!"" shouted Freddy, choking with anger and misery.  ""Beast!"" echoed the school.  Some one threw a wet sponge across the room, but Mr Rosher intercepted it.  ""Nay, nay, lads; don't waste your clean things on him.  Freddy and Teddy, my lads--where's Teddy?--come along home.  You've done with Galloway House.""  ""Why, sir--"" expostulated the wretched Jonah.  ""Hold thy tongue again,"" roared the farmer.  ""Coom away, lads.  Thee can take a half-holiday to-day, all of you, and if thy parents ask why, say Farmer Rosher will tell them.""  ""I'll have you prosecuted,"" growled Trimble, ""for interfering with my--""  ""Dost want to be shut up in yon cupboard?"" roared the hot-headed farmer. And the hint was quite enough.  Galloway House on that day turned a corner.  Farmer Rosher, who had sore doubts in his own mind whether he had done good or harm by his interference, spoke his mind freely to his neighbours on the subject of Jonah Trimble, a proceeding in which his two sons heartily backed him up.  The consequence was that that worthy young pedagogue found his scholastic labours materially lightened--for a dozen boys are easier to teach than fifty--and had time to wonder whether after all he would not have served his day and generation quite as well by looking after his own affairs, as after the most unprofitable affairs of somebody else.    CHAPTER TEN.  TOSSED ABOUT.  Jeffreys, as the reader will have discovered, did not possess the art of doing himself common justice.  He had brooded so long and so bitterly over his fatal act of violence at Bolsover, that he had come almost to forget that accident had had anything to do with poor Forrester's injuries.  And now, when confronted with his crime, even by a despicable wretch like Trimble, he had not the spirit to hold up his head and make some effort at any rate to clear himself of all that was charged against him.  Jeffreys was still a blunderer, or else his conscience was unusually sensitive.  You and I, reader, no doubt, would have put a bold face on the matter, and insisted the whole affair was entirely an accident, and that we were to be pitied rather than blamed for what had happened.  And a great many people would have pitied us accordingly.  But Jeffreys claimed no pity.  He saw nothing but his own ruthless fault; and he chose to take the whole burden of it, and the burden of the accident besides, on his own shoulders.  And so it was he left Galloway House without a word, and cast himself and his bad name once more adrift on a pitiless world.  But as he walked on he was not thinking of Galloway House, or Farmer Rosher, or Freddy or Teddy.  The last words of Trimble rang in his ears, and deafened him to all beside.  ""He's dead--_I_ can tell you that!""  It never occurred to him to wonder whence Jonah had derived his information, or whether it was true or false.  Mr Brampton's letter five months ago had left little hope of the boy's recovery, but not till now had Jeffreys heard any one say, in so many words ""He is dead.""  Jonah apparently knew the whole story.  How he had discovered it, it was useless to guess.  And yet for a moment Jeffreys was tempted to return and seize his accuser by the throat and demand the truth of him.  But he dismissed the notion with a shudder.  His steps turned, half mechanically, half by chance, towards his guardian's house.  He had never been in that quarter of York since the night of his expulsion, and he did not know why of all places he should just now turn thither.  His guardian, as he well knew, was even more pitiless and cynical than ever, and any hope of finding shelter or rest under his roof he knew to be absurd.  He might, however, be out; indeed, he had spoken of going to America, in which case Mrs Jessop might be there alone.  One clings to the idea of a home; and this place, such as it was, was the only place which for Jeffreys had ever had any pretensions to the blessed name.  His expectations--if he had any--vanished as he abruptly turned the corner of the street and stood in front of the house.  The shutters on the lower floor were closed, and the windows above were curtainless and begrimed with dust.  A notice ""To let,"" stared out from a board beside the front door, and the once cosy little front garden was weed-grown and run to seed.  Jeffreys felt a stronger man as he walked out of York in the deepening twilight.  He was in the way of old associations just now, for almost without knowing it he found himself quitting York by way of Ash Lane, every step of which by this time was familiar--painfully familiar ground.  The bank on which he had last found Jonah's knife had now new attractions for him.  Not so a garden shed, by the back of which he passed, and whence proceeded the glimmer of a light, and the sound of boys' voices.  He could not help standing a moment, and motioning Julius close to his heels, listening.  ""It's broken worse than ever now,"" said Freddy.  ""It's no use trying to mend it.""  ""Jeff could have done it.  I say, Freddy, whatever did father mean?""  ""I don't know.  All I know is I'll never forget dear old Jeff; shall you?""  ""Rather not.  I'm going to pray for him once a day, Freddy.""  ""All serene--so shall I.""  Jeffreys stole one hurried glance through the cracked timbers, and then walked away quickly and with a heart brim full.  Whenever in after days his soul needed music, he had only to call up the voices of those two little fellows in the shed as he last heard them. Little heeded they what came of their childish words.  Little heeded they that they were helping to make a true man of the Jeff they loved, and that whatever true strength he came to possess for fighting life's battles and bearing life's burdens, he owed it beyond any one to them!  He walked on rapidly and steadily for two hours, until the last lingering glow of the summer light had faded from the sky, and the lights of York behind him were lost in the night.  A field of new-mown hay provided him with the most luxurious bedroom man could desire.  The thought uppermost in his mind when he awoke next morning was young Forrester.  He felt that it would be useless for him to attempt anything or hope for anything till he had ascertained whatever was to be known respecting the boy's fate.  Trimble's words, which rang in his ears, had a less positive sound about them.  At least he would find out for himself whether they were true or false.  Grangerham, the small country town in which he had ascertained Forrester lived, and to which he had been removed from Bolsover, was far enough away from York.  Jeffreys had many a time sought it out on the map, and speculated on how it was to be reached, should a summons arrive to call him thither.  It was seventy miles away as the crow flies.  Jeffreys had the way there by heart.  He knew what time the trains left York, what were the junctions along the line, and how far the nearest railway station would take him to his journey's end.  Now, however, it was a question of walking, not riding.  The two pounds in his pocket, all he possessed, scarcely seemed his at all as long as Mr Frampton's school bill was unsettled.  At any rate, it was too precious to squander in railway fares for a man who could walk for nothing.  It was a long, harassing journey, over moors and along stony roads.  It was not till the evening of the second day that the footsore traveller read on a sign-post the welcome words, ""Four miles to Grangerham.""  He had eaten little and rested little on the way, and during the last twelve hours a broiling sun had beaten down pitilessly upon him.  If the journey of the two last days had been exhausting, the fruitless search of the day that followed was fully as wearisome.  Grangerham was a pretty big manufacturing town, and Jeffreys' heart sank within him as soon as he entered it.  For who among these busy crowds would be likely to know anything of an invalid old lady and her cripple grandson?  In vain he enquired in street after street for Mrs Forrester's address. Some had not heard the name.  Some knew a public-house kept by one Tony Forrester.  Some recollected an old lady who used to keep a costermonger's stall and had a baby with fits.  Others, still more tantalising, began by knowing all about it, and ended by showing that they knew nothing.  At the police-office they looked at him hard, and demanded what he wanted with anybody of the name of Forrester.  At the post-office they told him curtly they could not tell him anything unless he could give the old lady's address.  At length, late in the day, he ventured to knock at the door of the clergyman of that part of the town in which the only few residents' houses seemed to be, and to repeat his question there.  The clergyman, a hard-working man who visited a hundred families in a week, at first returned the same answer as everybody else.  No, he did not know any one of that name.  ""Stay,"" he said; ""perhaps you mean old Mrs Wilcox.""  Jeffreys groaned.  Everybody had been suggesting the name of some old lady to him different from the one he wanted.  ""She had a nephew, I think, who was a cripple.  The poor fellow had had an accident at school, so I heard.  I almost think he died.  I never saw him myself, but if you come with me, I'll take you to the Wesleyan minister.  I think he knows Mrs Wilcox.""  Thankful for any clue, however slight, Jeffreys accompanied the good man to the Wesleyan minister.  ""Mrs Wilcox--ah, yes,"" said the latter, when his brother pastor had explained their errand.  ""She died in Torquay five months ago.  She was a great sufferer.""  ""And her nephew?"" inquired the clergyman.  ""Her grandson, you mean.""  Jeffreys' heart leapt.  ""What was his name?"" he asked, excitedly.  ""Forrester; a dear young fellow he was.  His mother, who died out in India, was Mrs Wilcox's only daughter.  Yes, poor Gerard Forrester was brought home from school about six months ago terribly crippled by an accident.  It was said one of his school-fellows had--""  ""But where is he now? tell me, for mercy's sake!"" exclaimed Jeffreys.  ""I cannot tell you that,"" replied the minister.  ""His grandmother was ordered to Torquay almost as soon as he arrived home.  He remained here about a month in charge of his old nurse; and then--""  ""He's not dead!"" almost shouted Jeffreys.  ""Then,"" continued the minister, ""when the news came of his grandmother's death, they left Grangerham.  From all I can hear, Mrs Wilcox died very poor.  I believe the nurse intended to try to get him taken into a hospital somewhere; but where or how I never knew.  I was away in London when they disappeared, and have never heard of them since.""  ""Isn't his father alive?""  ""Yes.  I wrote to him by Mrs Wilcox's request.  He is an officer in India in the Hussars.  I have had no reply, and cannot be sure that the letter has reached him, as I see that his regiment has been dispatched to Afghanistan.""  ""Did you never hear from the nurse?"" asked Jeffreys.  ""Never.""  ""And was it thought Forrester would recover?""  ""I believe it was thought that if he got special treatment in a hospital his life might be spared.""  This then was all Jeffreys could hear.  Jonah Trimble might be right after all.  How he abused himself for flying from York as he had done without extracting the truth first!  It was too late now.  He begged to be taken to see the house where Forrester lived.  It was occupied by a new tenant, and all he could do was to pace up and down in front of it, in a lonely vigil, and try to imagine the pale face which only a few months back had gazed wearily from those windows on the active life without, in which he was never more to take a share.  He had not the courage to wait that night in Grangerham, although the minister urged him and Julius, tramps as they were, to do so.  He felt stifled in these narrow streets, and longed for the fresh heath, where at least he could be alone.  He accepted, however, the hospitality of his guide for half an hour in order to write a short note to Mr Frampton.  He said:--  ""I have come here hoping to hear something of Forrester.  But I can hear nothing more than what you told me four months ago.  He has left here in charge of his old nurse, and has not been heard of since.  You will wonder why I have left York.  The story of what happened at Bolsover reached the ears of my employer's son.  He accused me of it before all the school, and added that he knew Forrester was dead.  I could not stand it, and came away--though I feel now I was foolish not to ascertain first how he had learned what you and I have not yet been able to hear.  It is too terrible to believe! and I cannot believe it till I find out for myself.  Where I shall go next I do not know, and feel I do not care.  My guardian has left York.  I saw him two days before I came away, and he told me then he should refuse to pay my last half-term's bill, which came to 7.  I enclose thirty shillings now--all I have; and you may depend on my sending the rest as soon as I can earn it; for I shall be miserable as long as I owe a farthing to Bolsover.""  Having written this dismal letter, and having posted it with its enclosure, he bade farewell to Grangerham, and wandered forth with the sympathetic Julius out on to the quiet heath, and there lay down--not to sleep, but to think.    CHAPTER ELEVEN.  WILDTREE TOWERS.  Jeffreys spoke truly when he wrote to Mr Frampton that he did not know and did not care where he was going next.  When he awoke in his heathery bed next morning, he lay indolently for a whole hour for no other reason than because he did not know whether to walk north, south, east or west. He lacked the festive imagination which helps many people under similar circumstances.  It did not occur to him to toss up, nor was he aware of the value of turning round three times with his eyes closed and then marching straight before him.  Had he been an errant knight, of course his horse would have settled the question; but as it was, he was not a knight and had not a horse.  He had a dog, though.  He had found Julius in possession of the caretaker at his guardian's house, and had begged her to let him have him.  ""Which way are we going, Julius?"" inquired the dog's master, leaning upon his elbow, and giving no sign which the dog could possibly construe into a suggestion.  Julius was far too deep an animal not to see through an artless design like this.  But for all that he undertook the task of choosing.  He rose from his bed, shook himself, rubbed a few early flies off his face, and then, taking up the bundle in his teeth, with a rather contemptuous sniff, walked sedately off, in the direction of the North Pole. Jeffreys dutifully followed; and thus it was that one of the most momentous turns in his life was taken in the footsteps of a dog.  Let us leave him, reader, tramping aimlessly thus o'er moor and fell, and hill and dale, leaving behind him the smoke of the cotton country and the noisy shriek of the railway, and losing himself among the lonely valleys and towering hills of Westmoreland--let us leave him, footsore, hungry, and desponding, and refresh ourselves in some more cheery scene and amidst livelier company.  Where shall we go? for we can go anywhere.  That's one of the few little privileges of the storyteller.  Suppose, for instance, we take farewell of humble life altogether for a while, and invite ourselves into some grand mansion, where not by the remotest possibility could Jeffreys or Jeffreys' affairs be of the very slightest interest.  What do you say to this tempting-looking mansion, marked in the map as Wildtree Towers, standing in a park of I should not like to say how many acres, on the lower slopes of one of the grandest mountains in the Lake country?  On the beautiful summer afternoon on which we first see it, it certainly looks one of the fairest spots in creation.  As we stand on the doorstep, the valley opens out before us, stretching far to the south, and revealing reaches of lake and river, broad waving meadows and clustering villages, wild crags and pine-clad fells.  We, however, do not stand on the doorstep to admire the view, or even to ask admission.  We have the storyteller's latchkey and invisible cap. Let us enter.  As we stand in the great square hall, hung round in baronial style with antlers, and furnished in all the luxury of modern comfort, wondering through which of the dozen doors that open out of the square it would be best worth our while to penetrate, a footman, bearing a tray with afternoon tea, flits past us.  Let us follow him, for afternoon tea means that living creatures are at hand.  We find ourselves in a snug little boudoir, furnished and decorated with feminine skill and taste, and commanding through the open French windows a gorgeous view down the valley.  Two ladies, one middle-aged, one young, are sitting there as the footman enters.  The elder, evidently the mistress of the mansion, is reading a newspaper; the younger is dividing her time between needlework and looking rather discontentedly out of the window.  It is quite evident the two are not mother and child.  There is not the slightest trace of resemblance between the handsome aquiline face of the elder, stylishly-dressed woman, and the rounder and more sensitive face of her quietly-attired companion.  Nor is there much in common between the frank eyes and mock-demure mouth of the girl, and the half- imperious, half-worried look of her senior.  ""Tell Mr Rimbolt, Walker,"" says the mistress, as she puts down her paper, and moves her chair up to the tea-table, ""and Master Percy.""  A handsome gentleman, just turning grey, with an intellectual and good- humoured face, strolls into the room in response to Walker's summons.  ""I was positively nearly asleep,"" he says; ""the library gets more than its share of the afternoon sun.""  ""It would be better for you, dear, if you took a drive or a walk, instead of shutting yourself up with your old books.""  The gentleman laughs pleasantly, and puts some sugar in his tea.  ""You are not very respectful to my old friends,"" said he.  ""You forget how long we've been parted.  Where's Percy?""  ""Walker has gone to tell him.""  ""I think he is out,"" said the young lady; ""he told me he was going down to the river.""  ""I consider,"" said Mrs Rimbolt rather severely, ""he should tell _me_ what he is going to do, not you.""  ""But, aunt, I didn't ask him.  He volunteered it.""  ""Fetch your uncle's cup, Raby.""  Raby's mouth puckers up into a queer little smile as she obeys.  Walker appears in a minute to confirm the report of Master Percy's absence.  ""He's been gone this three hours, mem.""  ""Let some one go for him at once, Walker.""  ""I get so terrified when he goes off like this,"" says the mother; ""there's no knowing what may happen, and he is so careless.""  ""He has a safe neck,"" replies the father; ""he always does turn up.  But if you are so fidgety, why don't you send Raby to look after him?""  ""If any one went with him, it would need to be some one who, instead of encouraging him in his odd ways, would keep him in hand, and see he did not come to any harm.""  ""Oh,"" says Raby, laughing, ""he wouldn't take me with him if I paid him a hundred pounds.  He says girls don't know anything about science and inventions.""  ""He is probably right,"" observes Mrs Rimbolt severely.  ""Certainly, as regards the science _he_ practises,"" says her husband. ""What was it he had in hand last week?  Some invention for making people invisible by painting them with invisible paint?  Ha! ha!  He invited me to let him try it on me.""  ""He _did_ try it on me,"" chimes in Raby.  ""It is nothing to laugh about,"" says the mother; ""it is much better for him to be of an inquiring turn of mind than--idle,"" adds she, looking significantly at her niece's empty hand.  ""It strikes me it is we who are of an inquiring turn of mind just now,"" said the father.  ""I fancy he'll turn up.  He generally does. Meanwhile, I will go and finish my writing.""  And he politely retires.  ""Raby, my dear,"" says Mrs Rimbolt--Raby always knows what is coming when a sentence begins thus--""Raby, my dear, it does not sound nice to hear you making fun of your cousin.  Percy is very good to you--""  ""Oh yes!"" interrupts Raby, almost enthusiastically.  ""Which makes it all the less nice on your part to make a laughing-stock of him in the presence of his own father.  It may seem unlikely that people should be rendered invisible--""  Mrs Rimbolt stops, conscious she is about to talk nonsense, and Raby gallantly covers her retreat.  ""I'm sure I wish I knew half what he does about all sorts of things.""  ""I wish so too,"" replies the aunt, severely and ungratefully.  Several hours pass, and still Master Percy does not put in an appearance.  As Mrs Rimbolt's uneasiness increases, half a dozen servants are sent out in various directions to seek the prodigal.  It is an almost daily ceremony, and the huntsmen set about their task as a matter of course.  No one can recollect an occasion on which Master Percy has ever come home at the right time without being looked for.  If the appointed hour is four, every one feels well treated if his honour turns up at five.  Nor, with the exception of his mother, and now and then Raby, does any one dream of becoming agitated for three or four hours later.  When therefore, just as the family is sitting down to dinner at half- past six, Walker enters radiant to announce that Master Percy has come in, no one thinks any more about his prolonged absence, and one or two of the servants outside say to one another that the young master must be hungry to come home at this virtuous hour.  This surmise is probably correct, for Percy presents himself in a decidedly dishevelled condition, his flannel costume being liberally bespattered with mud, and his hair very much in need of a brush and comb.  You cannot help liking the boy despite the odd, self-willed solemnity of his face.  He is between fourteen and fifteen apparently, squarely built, with his mother's aquiline features and his father's strong forehead.  The year he has spent at Rugby has redeemed him from being a lout, but it is uncertain whether it has done anything more.  The master of his house has been heard to predict that the boy would either live to be hanged or to become a great man.  Some of his less diplomatic school- fellows had predicted both things, and when at the end of a year he refused point blank to return to school, and solemnly assured his father that if he was sent back he should run away on the earliest opportunity, it was generally allowed that for a youth of his age he had some decided ideas of his own.  The chief fault about him, say some, is that he has too many ideas of his own, and tries to run them all together.  But we are digressing, and keeping him from his dinner.  ""My dear boy, where have you been?"" says the mother; ""we have been looking for you everywhere.""  ""Oh, out!"" replies Percy, hastily taking stock of the bill of fare.  ""Well, run and dress yourself, or dinner will be cold.""  ""I'm too fagged,"" says Percy, coolly taking a seat.  ""Some soup, please.""  ""I can't have you sit down in that state, Percy,"" says Mr Rimbolt; ""it is not polite to your mother and Raby.""  ""If the poor boy is tired,"" says Mrs Rimbolt, ""we must excuse him this once.""  So Mr Rimbolt, as has happened more than once before, gives in, and Percy does as he pleases.  He does full justice to his dinner, and takes no part in the conversation, which is chiefly carried on by Mr Rimbolt, sometimes with his wife, sometimes with Raby.  At length, however, the first cravings of appetite being subdued, he shows a readiness to put in his oar.  ""How goes the invisible paint, Percy?"" asks his father, with a twinkle in his eye.  ""Used up,"" replies the boy solemnly.  ""I'm sure it would answer.  I painted Hodge with it, and could scarcely see him at all from a distance.""  ""I believe you paint yourself,"" says Raby, laughing, ""and that's why the men can't find you.""  Percy is pleased at this, and takes it as a recognition of his genius. He has great faith in his own discovery, and it is everything to him to find some one else believing in it too.  ""If you like to come to the river to-morrow, I'll show you something,"" says he condescendingly.  ""It licks the paint into fits!""  ""Raby will be busy in the village to-morrow,"" says her aunt.  ""What is it you are doing at the river?""  ""Oh, ah!"" solemnly responds the son, whose year at a public-school has not taught him the art of speaking respectfully to his parents; ""wouldn't you like to know?""  ""I wish you'd play somewhere else, dear.  It makes me so uneasy when you are down by the river.""  ""Play!"" says Percy rather scornfully; ""I don't play there--I work!""  ""I fear you are neglecting one sort of work for another, my boy,"" says Mr Rimbolt; ""we never got through Virgil yet, you know--at least, you didn't.  I've been through three books since you deserted our readings.""  ""Oh, Virgil's jolly enough,"" replied the boy; ""I'm going to finish it as soon as my experiments are over.""  ""What experiments?""  ""Oh, it's a dodge to--I'd show it you as soon as it's finished.  It's nearly done now, and it will be a tremendous tip.""  This is all that can be extracted from the youthful man of science--at least, by the elders.  To Raby, when the family retires to the drawing- room, the boy is more confidential, and she once more captivates him by entering heart and soul into his project and entreating to be made a party in the experiments.  ""I'd see,"" says he; ""but mind you don't go chattering!""  Mr Rimbolt gravitates as usual to his library, and here it is that half an hour later his son presents himself, still in his working garb.  ""Father,"" says the hopeful, ""please can you give me some money?""  ""Why, you have had ten shillings a week since you came home!""  ""Aren't you a millionaire, father?""  ""Some people say so.""  ""Doesn't that mean you've got a million pounds?""  ""That's what `millionaire' means.""  ""Ten shillings a week is only twenty-six pounds a year.""  ""Quite right, and few boys get such good pocket-money.""  ""When I come into the property I shall allow my son more than that,"" says Percy gravely.  ""Not if you love him as much as I love my son,"" says Mr Rimbolt, with a pleasant smile.  ""Good-night, father.""  ""Good-night!  Why, it's only half-past seven.""  ""I know.  I'm going to _get_ up early; I've got a lot of work to do. Besides, I'm miserable.""  ""Why?""  ""Because I can't get any money.""  ""Why not earn some?  I want some one to catalogue my books for me.  What do you say to doing it?  I shall pay half a crown a shelf.""  Percy hesitates a bit, and looks at the bookcases, and makes a mental calculation.  ""That will be about twelve pounds, won't it?  Have you got a book to write the names on?""  ""What!  Are you going to begin now?""  ""Yes.""  And Percy sits up till eleven o'clock, and succeeds in that time in cataloguing after a fashion, and not badly for a first attempt, two of the smallest shelves in the library, for which he receives then and there five shillings, much to his own comfort and to his father's amusement.  Mrs Rimbolt comes into the library just as the business is concluded.  ""Why, Percy, not in bed--and so tired too!""  ""Oh, I've been doing some work for father,"" says the boy, chinking the two half-crowns in his pocket.  ""But your father, I'm sure, would not wish you to injure your health.""  ""Certainly not.  Percy was hard up, and has just been earning five shillings.""  ""What do you mean--earning five shillings?""  ""Yes--father's been tipping me for cataloguing his books.  Jolly hard work, but he pays on the nail, don't you, father?""  ""My dear boy,"" said the mother, as she and her son walks across the hall, ""why did you not tell me you wanted money?  You know I do not grudge it.  I don't like you to stay up so late to earn it, when you ought to be resting.""  ""Well, I wouldn't mind another five shillings, mother.""  The mother gives him a half-sovereign and kisses him.  Percy, as he walks up the stairs, ruminating on his good luck, feels considerably more self-respect when he looks at the two half-crowns than when looking at the half-sovereign.  At the top of the stairs he shouts down to Walker:--  ""I say, wake me at six, will you? and leave my waterproof and top-boots on the hall table; and, I say, tell Mason to cut me a dozen strong ash sticks about a yard long; and, I say, leave a hammer and some tacks on the hall table too; and tell Appleby to go by the early coach to Overstone and get me a pound of cork, and some whalebone, and some tar. Here's five shillings to pay for them.  Don't forget.  Tell him to leave them at the lodge before twelve, and I'll fetch them.  Oh, and tell Raby if she wants to see what I was telling her about, she had better hang about the lodge till I come.  I'm sure to be there somewhere between twelve and four.""  With which the young lord of creation retires to his cubicle, leaving Walker scratching his head, and regarding the five shillings in his hand in anything but a joyful mood.  ""He ought to be put on the treadmill a week or two; that's what would do him good,"" observed the sage retainer to himself; ""one thing at a time, and plenty of it.  A dozen ash sticks before six o'clock in the morning! What does he want with ash sticks?  Now his schoolmaster, if he'd got one, would find them particular handy.""  With which little joke Walker goes off to agitate Appleby and Mason with the news of their early morning duties, and to put the servants' hall in a flutter by announcing for the fiftieth time that summer that either he or the young master would have to leave Wildtree Towers, because, positively--well, they would understand--a man's respect for himself demanded that he should draw the line somewhere, and that was just what Master Percy would not allow him to do.  We have changed the scene once already in this chapter.  Just before we finish let us change it once more, and leaving beautiful Wildtree and its happy family, let us fly to a sorry, tumbledown, desolate shed five miles away, on the hill-side.  It may have once belonged to a farm, or served as a shelter for sheep on the mountain-slopes.  But it now scarcely possesses a roof, and no sign of a habitation is anywhere visible.  The night has come on rainy and dark, and a weary tramp with his dog has been thankful to crawl into its poor shelter and rest his limbs.  The wind has risen and howls dismally round the shed, breaking every now and then through the loose planks, and stirring up the straw which carpets the place.  But the traveller is too weary to heed it or the rain which intrudes along with it, and crouching with his dog in the darkest corner, curls himself up in true tramp fashion, and settles down to sleep.  He has lain there two hours or more, and the mountain storm begins to abate.  The dog has been uneasy for some time, and now in the midst of a peal of thunder awakens his master with a gruff yap.  The sleeper sits up in an instant.  It is not the thunder that has disturbed the dog, nor is it thunder that the tramp now listens to close at hand.  It is the sound of voices, either inside the shed or just outside it.  Not a strange thing, perhaps, in a storm like this, for two wayfarers like himself to seek shelter--and yet the tramp seems startled by the sound, and signals to the dog to lie down and hold his peace.  ""Will it do?"" says one voice; and the tramp perceives that the speakers are standing outside the shed under the shelter of the projecting eaves.  ""No.  No good.  Too well looked after, and the people about the wrong sort.""  ""There's a pile of swag there--heaps.""  ""Know that.  Better wait till the family are away.""  ""There's a child, isn't there?""  ""A boy--fourteen--only child.""  ""Might work it that way; eh?  Get a trifle for him eh?""  ""A thousand, and no questions asked.  It's settled.""  ""It is!  Why didn't you say so?  How are you going to do it?""  ""Never you mind.  Corporal and I have worked it out.  It will be done to-night.  Moon's down at ten.  You be here at midnight, and have your hay-cart handy.  Corporal and I will bring him here.  We know where to find him in daylight, and can keep him quiet in the woods till dark.""  ""What then?  Who's to keep him?""  ""Wait till you've got him.""  ""Are you sure they'll go a thousand for him?""  ""Probably two.  Sheer off now, and don't forget, twelve o'clock.""  The footsteps move away through the wet heather, and the tramp, waiting motionless till the last sound has faded away, draws a long breath and curls himself back into his roost.  But not to sleep--to meditate a campaign.  ""Julius,"" says he to the dog, who appears to be fully alive to the brewing storm, ""you and I will have to stop this business.  There'll be three to two, unless the boy fights too.  We must be here at eleven, and tackle one of them before the other two come.  What do you say to that?""  Julius looks only sorry the business is not to begin at once.  Then the tramp and he go carefully into the plan of their little campaign, and, as soon as day dawns, go out for a walk, Julius taking care before quitting the shed to acquaint himself with the scent of the two gentlemen who had lately sheltered outside it.  The tramp spends a quiet day on the mountain, reading Homer, and admiring the view.  Towards nightfall he descends to Overstone and spends a few of his remaining pence in a frugal meal.  Then, as the moon dips behind the shoulder of Wild Pike, he betakes himself, with the faithful Julius close at his heels, to the shed on the mountain-side.    CHAPTER TWELVE.  KIDNAPPING.  Percy Rimbolt, despite his unusual literary labours of the past evening, rose promptly when Walker knocked at his door at six o'clock, and arrayed himself once more in his flannels.  The storm of the night, which had disturbed Jeffreys and his dog five miles away, had not spread as far as Wildtree, and the early summer sun was already hot as he sallied forth with his waterproof over one arm, and his dozen ash sticks under the other in the direction of the river. Kennedy, at the lodge, was considerably astonished to be awakened by a shower of gravel against his window, and to perceive, on looking out, the young master in full fishing order standing below, ""Kennedy, Appleby's going to leave some things here for me about twelve o'clock. Mind you're in, and wait till I come for them.  And if Raby comes, tell her I'll be up about then; tell her not to go away.""  ""Do you want me down at the river, sir?"" asked the old keeper.  ""No, keep away; and don't let any one else come below Rodnet Bridge."" With which injunction the youthful man of science went on his way, leaving Kennedy to shake his head and wonder what little game the young master was up to now.  Percy plodded on a couple of miles down the stream, considerably beyond the park boundaries, till he reached Rodnet Bridge, under which the mountain torrent slipped in a swift, deep stream.  Just below the bridge, among the trees which crowded down to the water's edge, was a little hut, used by the Wildtree keepers for depositing their baskets and nets, but now appropriated by the young heir of Wildtree for far more important purposes.  It was here, in fact, that during the last two days he had conceived, and begun to put into practice, the never-before-heard-of invention of a machine for enabling a swimmer to swim up-stream at the rate of eight to ten miles an hour!  Percy's recent career had been made up of a large number of magnificent projects, admirable in every respect but one--they never quite came off. Just as they neared perfection they ""gave out,"" and something new took their place.  It would be treason, however, to hint that the ""anti- current swimmer"" was ever likely to give out.  There certainly seemed no signs of it in the manner in which the inventor set about his task that morning.  He had been provident enough to bring some sandwiches in his pockets (provided at the last moment by the much-enduring Walker), and on the strength of these he laboured half the morning.  It would puzzle me to explain on what scientific principle the wonderful apparatus was laid down, what mixture between the wing of a bird, the tail of a fish, and the screw of a steamer it embodied.  I never was good at mechanics, and certainly Percy Rimbolt's mechanics were such as it is given but to few to follow.  Suffice it to say that by eleven o'clock the structure had reached a critical stage, and stood still for want of the cork which Appleby had been charged to procure.  The day was hot, and an hour at least must elapse before the messenger could return from Overstone.  Percy, therefore, improved the shining hour by a bathe in the clear stream, with whose depths he was evidently familiar.  He made no attempt, pending the completion of the machine, to oppose the swift current, but diving into it from the bridge, allowed himself luxuriously to be carried down into the shallows a hundred yards below, and without even the trouble of swimming.  This refreshing performance ended, he returned to the hut and dressed.  He was in the act of locking the door, preparatory to his journey up to Kennedy's lodge, when a sack was suddenly thrown over his head from behind, and next moment he found himself pinned to the ground in the clutches of two men.  Before he was well aware of what had happened, his feet were tied together, and his arms firmly lashed to his sides.  The sack was lifted from his mouth, but not long enough to enable him to shout, for a gag was roughly forced between his teeth; and then, while one of his captors held his head, the other bandaged his eyes so completely that, had he not known it, he could not have told whether it was mid-day or midnight. Thus, in almost less time than it takes to narrate it, in broad daylight, and on the borders of his own father's estate, the unfortunate Percy was made captive, without so much as being able to give an alarm or to see the faces of his assailants.  He was deposited comfortably on the floor of his own hut, by the side, oh, cruel fate! of his own machine, and there left to work out any number of problems which might occur to him during the next six hours; while his custodians, having carefully padlocked the door, retired to a respectful distance among the trees, where they could smoke their pipes in peace, and at the same time keep an eye on the approaches to their young ward's dungeon.  It did not take Percy many minutes to convince himself that any attempt to struggle or extricate himself from his bonds would be labour thrown away.  His captors were evidently well up to their business, and there was no wriggling out of their neatly-tied bonds.  Nor did the onslaught which the boy made with his teeth on the gag result in anything but disaster.  It loosened at least two of his teeth, and gave him during the remainder of the day considerable pain in some of the others.  As to his eyes, he rubbed his forehead and the side of his head on the floor, in the hopes of shifting the bandage, but all in vain.  He got it over his ears as well as his eyes for his pains, and could scarcely hear a sound.  As the afternoon went on, the sun slanted its rays cruelly through the little skylight on to the spot where he lay, and the flies, attracted by the rare chance, swarmed in under the door and through the cracks to make merry with their defenceless victim.  Had the sun been seven times as hot, or the flies venomous and deadly, he would have preferred it, for it would have shortened his misery considerably.  When at last the sun got across the window, and left him at peace, he was scarcely in a position to appreciate his mercies.  Not long after the distant Overstone chimes had sounded four, his heart (about the only unfettered portion of him) leapt to his mouth as he heard his name called in Raby's voice outside.  Nor was his the only heart whom that cheery sound caused to palpitate.  The two watchers in the wood above heard it, and prepared to decamp at a moment's notice, should the girl display any undue curiosity as to the contents of the hut.  But she did not.  She was used to seeing it padlocked, and to listen in vain for an answer to her call.  Percy was evidently abroad, probably waiting for her up at Kennedy's lodge.  So she hurried back.  As soon as she had disappeared beyond the bridge, the two men put their pipes into their pockets.  ""If they've begun looking for him we'd best sheer off, Corporal.""  ""That's right,"" replied Corporal--""at once.""  Whereupon they descended from their perches, and having looked carefully up and down, unlocked the dungeon door.  Their prisoner was lying so still and motionless, that for an instant they had their misgivings as to whether the gag had not been a trifle too much for his respiration.  But a moment's examination satisfied them the boy was alive--much to their relief.  The sack was once more brought into requisition, and turned out to be a great deal larger than it looked, for it was found quite roomy enough to accommodate the whole of the person of Percy Rimbolt, who in this dignified retreat quitted the scene of his labours on the back of one of his captors.  The hut having been once more carefully padlocked, the party travelled at least a mile into the depths of the lonely woods, where at least there was no lack of shade and seclusion.  Percy was deposited somewhat unceremoniously on the ground, and left in the sack (with just sufficient aperture in the region of his nose to allow of respiration) for some hours more, unheeded by his custodians except when he attempted to move or roll over, on which occasions he was sharply reminded of his duty to his company by an unceremonious kick.  Some time later--it may have been an hour or two, or only five minutes-- he was aware of a conversation taking place outside his sack.  ""Risky,"" said one voice.  ""More risky not to do it,"" said the other.  ""What use would he be if he was a dead 'un?  Besides, how are we to carry him all that way?""  ""All right, have it your way,"" said the other surlily.  Then Percy was conscious of some one uncording the mouth of the sack and uncovering his head.  ""Young feller,"" said the gruffer of the two voices, ""do you want your throat cut?""  Percy shook his head in mild deprecation of such a desire.  ""Do you want your tongue cut out?""  Once more Percy disclaimed any consuming anxiety in that direction.  ""Then you won't move a step or speak a word unless you're told.  Do you mark that?""  The boy nodded; he did mark it.  Thereupon, much to his relief, the gag was taken from his mouth, and he felt himself hauled out of the ignominious sack.  ""A drink!"" he gasped.  ""There he goes; I said he'd do it.  Clap the gag on again.""  Poor blindfolded Percy could only wave his head appealingly.  He would sooner have his throat cut than feel that gag back between his teeth. His captors let him off this once, and one of them untied the cords from his legs.  He was too cramped to attempt to make any use of this partial liberty, even had he been so minded, and sank down, half fainting, to the ground.  ""Give him a drink,"" said one of the voices; and in a moment or two he felt a cup of delicious water held to his parched lips, reviving him as if by magic.  A few coarse pieces of bread were also thrust between his lips; these he swallowed painfully, for his jaws were stiff and aching, and his teeth had almost forgotten their cunning.  However, when the meal was over he felt better, and would gladly have slept upon it for an hour or two, had he been allowed.  But this was no part of his captors' programme.  They had not relaxed his bonds to indulge any such luxurious craving.  Overstone Church had already sounded eleven, and they were due in an hour at the mountain shed.  ""Get up and step out,"" said one of them, pulling the boy roughly to his feet.  ""All very well,"" said Percy to himself, as he stumbled forward on his cramped limbs; ""they'll have to give me a leg up if they want me to go the pace.  Where are we going to next, I'd like to know?""  ""Come, stir yourself,"" said the man again, accompanying his words by a rough shake.  Percy responded by toppling over on his face.  He who knew the way to swim against stream ten miles an hour, was just now unable to walk half a dozen paces on solid ground.  ""Best shove him in the sack again,"" growled the other man.  The bare mention of that sack startled poor Percy to his feet.  If he might only have spoken he could easily have explained the trifling difficulty which prevented his ""stepping out.""  As it was, all he could do was to struggle forward bravely for a few more paces, and then again fall.  The men seemed to perceive that there was something more than mere playfulness in this twice-repeated performance, and solved the difficulty by clutching him one under each arm, and materially assisting his progress by dragging him.  Any of Percy's acquaintances would have been greatly shocked had they been privileged to witness this triumphal midnight progress across the moors; his dragging legs feebly trying to imitate the motions of walking, but looking much more like kneeling, his head dropped forward on his chest, his shoulders elevated by the grip of his conductors under his pinioned arms, and his eyes bandaged as never a blind-man's-buff could bind them.  It was a long weary march that; but to Percy it was luxury compared with the morning among the flies on the hut floor.  His conductors settled into a jog-trot, which the light weight of the boy did not much impede; and Percy, finding the motion not difficult, and on the whole soothing, dropped off into a half-doze, which greatly assisted in passing the time.  At length, however, he became aware of a halt and a hurried consultation between his captors.  ""Is he there?  Whistle?""  Corporal gave a low whistle, which after a second or two was answered from the hill-side.  ""That's all right!"" said the other, in tones of relief.  ""See anything of the cart?""  Corporal peered round in the darkness.  ""Yes--all right down there.""  ""Come on, then.  Keep your eye on Jim, though, he's a mighty hand at going more than his share.""  ""Trust me,"" growled Corporal.  Then Percy felt himself seized again and dragged forward.  In about five minutes they halted again, and the whistle was repeated.  The answer came from close at hand this time.  ""All square?"" whispered Corporal.  ""Yes!"" replied a new indistinct voice--""come on.""  ""Jim's screwed again,"" said the other man; ""I can tell it by his voice; there's no trusting him.  Come on.""  They had moved forward half a dozen steps more, when Corporal suddenly found his head enveloped in a sack--a counterpart of his own--while at the same moment the other man was borne to the ground with a great dog's fangs buried in his neckcloth.  ""Hold him!"" called Jeffreys to the dog, as he himself applied his energies to the subjugation of the struggling Corporal.  It was no easy task.  But Jeffreys, lad as he was, was a young Samson, and had his man at a disadvantage.  For Corporal, entangled with the sack and unprepared for the sudden onslaught, staggered back and fell; and before he could struggle to his feet Jeffreys was on him, almost throttling him.  It was no time for polite fighting.  If Jeffreys did not throttle his man, his man, as he perfectly well knew, would do more than throttle him.  So he held on like grim death, till Corporal, half smothered by the sack and half-choked by his assailant's clutch, howled for quarter.  Then for the first time Jeffreys felt decidedly perplexed.  If he let Corporal go, Corporal, not being a man of honour, might turn on him and make mincemeat of him.  If, on the other hand, he called the dog off the other man to hold Corporal while he bound him captive, the other man might abuse his opportunity in a like manner.  The boy was evidently too exhausted to take any part in the encounter?  What could he do?  After turning the matter over, he decided that Julius was the most competent individual to settle the business.  The dog was having a very easy time with the abject villain over whom he was mounting guard, and could well undertake a little more than he had at present on his hands.  ""Fetch him here, Julius,"" called Jeffreys, giving Corporal an additional grip; ""come here, you fellow, along with the dog.""  The fellow had nothing for it but to obey; and in a couple of minutes he was lying across the body of Corporal, while Julius stood fiercely over them both.  ""Come here, boy,"" called Jeffreys next to Percy; ""let me take off those cords.""  Percy groped his way to him.  ""What are you going to do with me?"" he gasped.  ""Loose you; and if you're half a man you'll help me tie up these brutes. Come on--watch them there, Julius.  Why, you're blindfolded, too, and how frightfully tight you're corded!""  ""I've been like that since twelve o'clock.""  A few moments sufficed to unfasten the captive's arms and clear his eyes.  ""Now you,"" said Jeffreys, indicating the topmost of Julius's captives with his toe, ""put your hands behind your back!""  The fellow obeyed hurriedly; he had had quite enough of Julius's attentions already to need more.  Jeffreys and Percy between them lashed first his wrists together, and then his elbows tightly to his sides.  Then they secured his feet and knees in the same manner.  ""He'll do--let him go, Julius,"" and prisoner Number 1 was rolled over, to make room for Number 2 to undergo a similar process of pinioning.  It was fortunate that the hay-cart below, of which and its owner Jeffreys and Julius had already taken possession at their leisure, had been liberally provided with cord, or their supply would have been inadequate to the strain put upon it.  At last, however, Corporal and his friend were as securely tied up as they themselves could have done it, and dragged into the shed.  It was pitch dark, and they neither of them at first perceived a third occupant of the tenement in the person of their fellow-conspirator, who was lying, bound like themselves, on the floor, where for an hour at least he had been enjoying the sweets of solitary meditation.  ""Now, Julius,"" said Jeffreys, when his three guests were duly deposited, ""you'll have to watch them here till I come back.  Hold your tongues, all of you, or Julius will trouble you.  Watch them, good dog, and stay here.""  ""Now,"" said he to the boy, when they found themselves outside, ""what's your name?""  ""Percy Rimbolt.""  ""Where do you live?""  ""Wildtree Towers, five miles away.""  ""We can be there in an hour.  We may as well use this cart, which was meant to drive you in another direction.  Can you walk to it, or shall I carry you?""  Percy, as one in a dream, walked the short distance leaning on his rescuer's arm.  Then, deposited on the soft hay, too weary to trouble himself how he got there, or who this new guardian might be, he dropped off into an exhausted sleep, from which he was only aroused by the sound of his parents' voices as the cart pulled up at the door of Wildtree Towers.    CHAPTER THIRTEEN.  POLICEMAN JULIUS.  Wildtree Towers had been thrown into a state of unmistakable panic when, at the usual hour of retiring for the night, Percy had not put in an appearance.  His absence at dinner-time agitated no one but his mother; and the search instituted at her bidding began languidly, and with the usual assurance of a speedy discovery.  But as hour passed hour and no tidings came, things began to look serious, and even Walker pulled a long face.  Midnight came, and still no tidings.  Appleby came up to the house for a lantern, but had nothing to report beyond the fact that the search so far had been unsuccessful.  The minutes dragged on for the unhappy watchers.  It was harder far for them to sit there in the hall, listening to the unsympathetic tick of the clock and starting at every sound on the gravel without, than it was for the father to tramp through the woods and trace the footsteps along the river's bank.  At last the clock struck two, and scarcely had the chimes ceased, when Walker put up his finger, and exclaimed,--  ""Hist!""  A moment of terrible silence ensued.  Then on their quickened hearing there came a distant rumble of wheels.  Almost at the same instant footsteps came tearing up the gravel drive.  It was Appleby, who rushed into the midst of the group assembled on the doorstep.  ""All right--he's found!"" gasped the lad.  ""Is he alive?"" cried the mother.  ""On a cart!"" exclaimed the panting Appleby.  Mrs Rimbolt gave a little shriek, and fell into her husband's arms. Raby, nerved by the very agony of the suspense, rushed out and ran down the drive to meet the cart.  ""Is Percy there?"" she cried.  The cart stopped abruptly, and a strange voice replied,--  ""Yes--safe and well and fast asleep.""  The words fell like music on the girl's ears.  It was too dark to see anything but the shadowy form of the cart and of a man walking at the horse's head.  She darted back to the house with the joyful news, and in another minute the cart stood at the door.  Percy, who was decidedly enjoying his sleep, felt by no means as grateful as he should have been to find himself disturbed at this early hour of the night.  ""All serene! all serene!"" he growled, in response to his mother's caresses and Walker's effusive shaking of the hand.  ""I'm all right, mother; I want to go to bed.""  ""Get the hot bath ready,"" said Mrs Rimbolt to the servants.  ""My poor boy!""  ""I tell you I'm all serene; can't you let me go to bed?"" said the half- awake Percy.  ""I don't want anything except sleep.""  ""Walker, help Master Percy up to bed; let him take our room, and light a fire in it, and put hot bottles in the bed.""  Percy, thankful to get back to his slumbers at any price, allowed Walker to help him up stairs.  At the door of his own room he stopped.  ""That will do; you can cut.  Walker.""  ""But you're to have the best room and a fire--""  ""You be hanged!"" exclaimed the boy, unceremoniously slamming the door in Walker's face, and locking himself in.  Downstairs, meanwhile, Jeffreys was being besieged with questions on all hands, which he endeavoured as best he could to answer.  Mr Rimbolt, however perceiving that very little good was to be got out of this confused cross-examination, asked him to follow him into the library, once more suggesting to his wife and niece that they should go to bed. Jeffreys was thankful to find himself in a serene atmosphere, and despite all the agitation and excitement of the day, his heart warmed as he looked round on the bookshelves and their friendly occupants.  ""Now,"" said Mr Rimbolt, who had made no attempt to take part in the babel outside, ""will you please tell me everything?""  Jeffreys obeyed, and told his story in a concise and intelligent manner, which convinced Mr Rimbolt he had not only an honest man but a gentleman to deal with.  The master of Wildtree was not an effusive man, and if Jeffreys had looked to be overwhelmed with grateful speeches he would have been disappointed.  But he had not looked for it, and valued far more the quiet confidential manner in which Mr Rimbolt entered into all the details of the narrative.  ""Then,"" said the latter, when the story was ended, ""as a matter of fact you have the three ruffians penned in the shed by your dog at this moment--an excellent piece of management.""  He rang his bell, and Walker, who had felt quite out of it for the half- hour, appeared with great promptitude.  ""Walker, are any of the men about still?""  ""Appleby is holding this man's horse at the hall door, sir.""  ""Send Appleby here, and take the horse and cart round to the farm.""  Poor Walker!  This was a sad cut.  The farm was half a mile away, across the park; and this order meant that for another hour at least he must be an outsider in the drama.  ""Appleby,"" said Mr Rimbolt, when that jaunty youth appeared, ""take Benbow, and ride as quickly as you can, to the police-office at Overstone.  Tell the inspector with my compliments, to meet me with three constables at Rodnet Bridge at six o'clock, that is, in three hours.  Come back as quickly as you can, and have the dog-cart at the door at five.""  ""Now,"" said he to Jeffreys, when these various matters of business had been put in train, ""we may as well occupy our time by getting something to eat, supper and breakfast in one--I dare say you are hungry.""  As Jeffreys had scarcely eaten anything for three days--in fact, since his visit to Grangerham--he could honestly admit being ready for a meal.  ""I'm afraid we must forage for ourselves, unless some one is about,"" said Mr Rimbolt, leading the way to the pantry.  It was a curious spectacle that of the millionaire and the tramp together investigating the contents of the pantry shelves and lockers, lifting up dish-covers here, and critically testing the consistency of pie-crusts there.  They made a fairly good selection of the good things which came nearest to hand, and retiring with them to the adjacent kitchen, accomplished a meal more luxurious to Jeffreys' mind than any he had tasted since he left Bolsover.  This done, to his great satisfaction they adjourned once more to the library, where, while Mr Rimbolt took a brief nap, he regaled himself with the luxury of a prowl among the bookshelves, by the light of the dawning day.  So absorbed was he in this occupation that he did not hear the sound of the dog-cart at the front door, or heed Mr Rimbolt's first summons to start.  ""You're fond of books, surely,"" said that gentleman, as the two got up into the trap and drove off, with Appleby perched behind.  ""I love them,"" said Jeffreys, in the same tone of sincerity which had attracted the York bookseller.  ""You're a reader, then?""  ""I would be if I had the chance,"" said Jeffreys.  ""You are thinking of my library,"" said Mr Rimbolt; ""but it doesn't follow, you know, that having a house full of books makes a reader.  A man may often get more good out of one tattered volume than out of an entire Russia-bound library.""  ""I can quite believe that,"" said Jeffreys.  ""Probably you know what a favourite book is?"" said Mr Rimbolt rather curiously.  Jeffreys replied by producing his well-worn copy of Homer, and it would be hard to say which of these two foolish persons evinced the most enthusiasm in discovering that they both alike had a friend in the old Greek bard.  At any rate the discovery levelled at once the social differences which divided them; and in the discussion which ensued, I blush to say they forgot, for the time being, all about Percy, and the shed on the mountain-side, and the three gentlemen there to whom the genial Julius was doing the honours.  The appearance of the inspector and three constables at Rodnet Bridge brought the two unpractical excursionists on Mount Olympus abruptly back to level ground.  The business was soon explained.  The police, of course, knew all about the ""parties""--when do they not?  They had been following them up for days, had had their suspicions of that mountain shed for weeks, and so on.  They couldn't exactly say they had known all about the attempt to kidnap last night; but they knew all about it now, for Appleby had let it out, and the ""active and intelligent"" in consequence had nothing to learn.  Half an hour brought them to the mountain-side.  Mr Rimbolt and Jeffreys dismounted, leaving Appleby in charge of the trap, while they, followed in single file by the police, ascended the narrow track towards the shed.  Half-way up, Jeffreys whistled; and a joyous bark from Julius assured the party that their game was safe.  ""You'd better let me go first,"" said Jeffreys to the inspector, who showed some anxiety to be foremost in the capture, ""unless you want my dog to fly at you.""  The official fell back promptly, his native modesty getting the better of his zeal; and the party halted twenty yards from the shed while Jeffreys advanced to reconnoitre.  He saw at a glance that things were not exactly as he had left them.  Two out of the three prisoners remained securely bound, but the unlucky Corporal had slipped his feet from the cords, and paid dearly for his folly.  Julius had him down on the ground, daring him to move a limb or even turn his head on pain of unheard-of laceration.  The wretched fellow had cursed a thousand times his own artfulness.  For three hours he had lain thus, not daring to stir a muscle; and if ever a night's experiences are enough to turn the hair grey, Corporal should not have a single black lock left that morning.  ""Come off, Julius, and let them alone,"" said Jeffreys.  Julius obeyed somewhat reluctantly, though the pleasant task of welcoming his master's return reconciled him somewhat to the abandonment of his sovereignty.  Jeffreys beckoned to the party to advance.  ""These are the three men, sir,"" said he to Mr Rimbolt.  ""Yes, sir, these are the parties,"" said the inspector (who had never set eyes on the men before), advancing towards Corporal as he slowly raised himself from the ground.  Julius, greatly to the officers' alarm, made a last attempt to assert his property in the captives, and in Corporal in particular; and in so doing came very near doing a grievous injury to the arm of the law.  But Jeffreys' authoritative order to him to come in and he down allowed the arrest to proceed without any further protest than a few discontented yaps as the cords were removed from the prisoners' legs, and they were led off by the force.  ""We had better go to Overstone, too,"" said Mr Rimbolt, ""and see these ruffians safely quartered.  The assizes are coming on in a week or two. Do you live anywhere near here?""  ""No,"" said Jeffreys.  ""Julius and I are on a walking tour at present.""  Mr Rimbolt looked at his companion, and for the first time took notice of his travel-stained, shabby appearance.  ""You mean,"" said he, guessing the truth, ""you have no particular address at present?""  ""Quite so,"" replied Jeffreys, flushing up uncomfortably.  Mr Rimbolt said nothing more just then.  They had a busy hour or two at Overstone arranging for the comfortable housing of their three prisoners, until the law should decide as to their more permanent residence.  Then, having taken farewell of the police, and returning towards the dog-cart, Jeffreys stopped abruptly and said, raising his hat,--  ""Good-bye, sir.""  Mr Rimbolt looked at him in surprise.  ""You are not going, surely!"" said he.  ""You must come back to the house with me.""  ""Thank you; Julius and I have a long journey before us, and must be starting.""  ""You are only on a walking tour, you know.  There is a great deal to see round here.  The place is worth exploring,"" said Mr Rimbolt feeling almost as embarrassed as his companion.  ""We shall be back here for the assizes,"" said Jeffreys.  ""Nonsense, my friend!"" said Mr Rimbolt, taking the bull by the horns; ""I insist on your coming back with me now, if it's only to ask how Percy is after his night's excitement.  Besides, you have not half explored the library.""  Whether it was the cordiality of this delicate invitation, or the mention of the library, or both combined, I cannot say; but Jeffreys, with some misgivings, yielded, and ascended the dog-cart.  ""The ladies would never forgive me,"" said Mr Rimbolt rather unwisely, ""if I let you go without giving them an opportunity of thanking you for your goodness to Percy.""  Jeffreys was sorry he had yielded.  Had he only had Mr Rimbolt and the cool Percy to deal with, he could have resigned himself to the ordeal. But the threat of being thanked by the ladies quite disconcerted him.  ""I'm--I'm afraid I'm not very--tidy,"" stammered he.  ""I'd really rather, if you don't object, go on.  Besides, Julius--""  Mr Rimbolt laughed good-humouredly.  ""Julius is not shy, and wants breakfast and a rest after his night's work, don't you, Julius?""  Julius could not deny that he was very ready for both.  Jeffreys gave it up, and with much sinking of heart awaited their arrival at Wildtree Towers.  To his infinite relief, the ladies were not visible.  Mrs Rimbolt, it was reported, was confined to her bed by the effects of her recent agitation, and Miss Atherton was out.  Master Percy was still fast asleep.  It broke the fall considerably to find himself left still to the gentlemanly and unembarrassing attentions of his host.  Julius was led with honour to the kitchen, there to be regaled in a baronial fashion, which it was well for his morals and digestion was not a daily festival.  Jeffreys, having seen him comfortably curled up on a mat, returned to the library.  His host was pacing up and down the floor, evidently a little nervous, and Jeffreys instinctively felt that the ordeal was upon him.  Mr Rimbolt, however, began by a little fencing.  ""I recollect taking a very pleasant tour through this district with two college friends when I was at Oxford.  See, here is the map I had with me at the time, and the route marked.  We were rather a rackety party, and boasted that we would go in a straight line from Ambleside to the sea, and stick at nothing.  Here's the line, you see.  That straight line took us over one or two places I wouldn't care to try now.  But Oxford men, they said in those days, had no necks to break.  Are you a University man?""  Jeffreys glanced up, half doubtful whether the question was asked in seriousness or ironically.  ""No, sir, unfortunately not.""  ""Well,"" said Mr Rimbolt, ""it has its advantages and disadvantages.  You would, I dare say, value it; but for the serious work of life it may sometimes be unsettling.  Is it fair to ask what your profession is, Mr Jeffreys?""  ""None at all just now.  I was till lately usher in a private school,"" replied Jeffreys, wincing.  Mr Rimbolt observed the wince, and delicately steered away from the topic.  ""Ah, that must be a monotonous calling, and you, with your love of books and literary tastes, would find it specially irksome.  You must forgive me if I take an interest in your affairs, Mr Jeffreys.  May I ask if you have any engagement in prospect?""  ""None at all,"" said Jeffreys.  ""My reason for asking is a selfish one, quite, and has been suggested by the interest you take in my library.  I have been inquiring for a month or two for some one who will assist me as a private librarian.  The fact is, Mr Jeffreys,"" continued Mr Rimbolt, noticing the look of surprised pleasure in his listener's face, ""with my time so much occupied in parliamentary and other duties, I find it quite impossible to attend to the care of my books as I should wish.  I made up my mind most reluctantly some time ago that I should have to entrust the duty to some one else, for it was always my pride that I knew where every book I had was to be found.  But my collection has grown beyond my control and wants a regular custodian.  Look here,"" said he, opening a folding door at the end of the room.  Jeffreys saw another room, larger than the one he was in, lined with shelves, and crowded on the floor with heaps of books in most admired disorder.  ""It was no use,"" said Mr Rimbolt half pathetically.  ""I cherished the hope as long as I was able of reducing this chaos to order, and putting away each one of these treasures (for they are no common volumes) in a place of its own.  Every day it grows worse.  I've fought against it and put it off, because I could find no one who would undertake it as much for the love of the work as for the small salary to which a private librarian would be entitled.  Now you see the selfish reason I have for mentioning the matter to you, Mr Jeffreys.  I offer you nothing to jump at; for it will need sheer hard work and a lot of drudgery to overtake the arrears of work, and after that I doubt if the keeping up of the library will leave you much leisure.  You would incur no little responsibility either, for if I handed the care of the library to you, I should hold you responsible for every volume in it, and should expect you to know something of the inside of the books as well as the outside. You may think a salary of 100 a year hardly adequate to this amount of work and responsibility; if so I must not press you further, for that is the sum I have arranged to give, and cannot see my way to offering more. It would include residence here, and board, of course.""  Jeffreys felt almost dazzled by the prospect thus deprecatingly unfolded by Mr Rimbolt.  Had the offer been made in any less delicate way; had it savoured of charity to the outcast, or reward to the benefactor, he would have rejected it, however tempting.  As it was, it seemed like the opening of one of the gates of Providence before him.  The work promised was what of all others he coveted; the salary, with the casually-thrown in addition of board and lodging, seemed like affluence; his employer was a gentleman, and the opportunities of study and self-improvement were such as fall to the lot of few.  Above all, in hard work among those quiet and friendly bookshelves he would find refuge from his bad name, and perhaps be able to establish for himself what he had hitherto striven for in vain--a character.  ""I am most grateful, sir,"" said he, ""if you really think I should suit you.""  ""I think you would,"" said Mr Rimbolt, in a tone which gratified Jeffreys far more than if he had launched out into idle flattery and compliments.  And so it was settled.  Jeffreys could scarcely believe what had happened to him when, half an hour later, Mr Rimbolt being called away on business, he found himself taking a preliminary survey of his new preserves, and preparing himself seriously for his duties as private librarian at Wildtree Towers.    CHAPTER FOURTEEN.  SNOB AND SNUB.  Jeffreys was not long in finding out the best and the worst of his new lot at Wildtree Towers.  To an ordinary thick-skinned fellow, with his love of books and partiality for boys, his daily life during the six months which followed his introduction under Mr Rimbolt's roof might have seemed almost enviable.  The whole of each morning was devoted to the duties of the library, which, under his conscientious management, gradually assumed the order of a model collection.  A librarian is born, not made, and Jeffreys seemed unexpectedly and by accident to have dropped into the one niche in life for which he was best suited.  Mr Rimbolt was delighted to see his treasures gradually emerging from the chaos of an overcrowded lumber-room into the serene and dignified atmosphere of a library of well-arranged and well-tended volumes.  He allowed his librarian _carte blanche_ with regard to shelves and binding.  He agreed to knock a third room into the two which already constituted the library, and to line it with bookcases.  He even went the length of supporting a clever bookbinder at Overstone for several months with work on his own volumes, and, greatest sacrifice of all, forebore his craze of buying right and left for the same space of time until the arrears of work should be overtaken, and a clear idea could be formed of what he already had and what he wanted.  Jeffreys revelled in the work, and when he discovered that he had to deal with one of the most valuable private collections in the country, his pride and sense of responsibility advanced step by step.  He occupied his leisure hours in the study of bibliography; he read books on the old printers and their works; he spent hours with the bookbinder and printer at Overstone, studying the mechanism of a book; he even studied architecture, in connexion with the ventilation and lighting of libraries, and began to teach himself German, in order to be able to master the stores of book- lore buried in that rugged language.  All this, then, was congenial and delightful work.  He was left his own master in it, and had the pride of seeing the work growing under his hands: and when one day Mr Rimbolt arrived from London with a great man in the world of old books, for the express purpose of exhibiting to him his treasures, it called an honest flush to the librarian's face to hear the visitor say, ""Upon my word, Rimbolt, I don't know whether to congratulate you most on your books or the way in which they are kept! Your librarian is a genius!""  If all his life could have been spent in the shelter of the library Jeffreys would have had little to complain of.  But it was not, and out of it it needed no great discernment to perceive that he had anything but a friend in Mrs Rimbolt.  She was not openly hostile; it was not worth her while to wage war on a poor domestic, but she seemed for all that to resent his presence in the house, and to be possessed of a sort of nervous desire to lose no opportunity of putting him down.  After about a week, during which time Jeffreys had not apparently taken her hint as to the arranging of his person in ""respectful"" raiment. Walker waited upon the librarian in his chamber with a brown-paper parcel.  ""My lady's compliments,"" said he, with a grin--he was getting to measure the newcomer by his mistress's standard--""and hopes they'll suit.""  It was a left-off suit of Mr Rimbolt's clothes, with the following polite note: ""As Mr Jeffreys does not appear disposed to accept Mrs Rimbolt's advice to provide himself with clothes suitable for the post he now occupies at Wildtree Towers, she must request him to accept the accompanying parcel, with the wish that she may not again have occasion to refer to so unpleasant a subject.""  Jeffreys flushed scarlet as he read this elegant effusion, and, greatly to Walker's astonishment crushed the letter up into a ball and flung it out of the window.  ""Take that away!"" he shouted, pointing to the parcel.  ""The mistress sent it for--""  ""Take it away, do you hear?"" shouted Jeffreys, starting up with a face so terrible that Walker turned pale, and evacuated the room with the offending parcel as quickly as possible.  Jeffreys' outburst of temper quickly evaporated, and indeed gave place to a much more prolonged fit of shame.  Was this like conquering the evil in his nature, to be thus thrown off his balance by a trifle?  As it happened, he had ordered a suit of clothes in Overstone some days back, and was expecting them that very afternoon.  Mr Rimbolt, on the day after his engagement, had as delicately as possible offered him a quarter's salary in advance, which Jeffreys, guessing the source which inspired the offer, had flatly refused.  Mr Rimbolt's gentlemanly urging, however, and the consciousness that his present clothes were disreputable, as well as another consideration, induced him to accept a month's stipend; and on the strength of this he had visited the Overstone tailor.  But before doing so he had discharged his mind of a still more important duty.  The sense of the debt still due to Bolsover had hung round his neck night and day.  It was not so much on Mr Frampton's account.  He came gradually to hate the thought of Bolsover, and the idea of being a defaulter to the place worried him beyond measure.  It seemed like an insult to the memory of poor young Forrester to owe money to the place which had witnessed that terrible tragedy; and the hope of washing his hands once for all of the school and its associations was the one faint gleam of comfort he had in looking back on the events of last year.  It was therefore with a feeling of almost fierce relief that he procured a post-office order for the balance of his debt on the very afternoon of receiving the money, and enclosing it with merely his name added--for he wanted no receipt, and felt that even Mr Frampton's letters would now no longer be of service to him--he posted it with his own hands, and hoped that he was done with Bolsover for ever.  After that, with very different emotions, he visited the tailor.  The clothes arrived on the same afternoon which had witnessed the summary rejection of Mrs Rimbolt's gift.  That lady, from whom Walker had considered it prudent to keep back some of the particulars of his interview with the librarian, merely reporting ""that Mr Jeffreys was much obliged, but did not require the things,"" took to herself all the credit of his improved appearance when that evening Mr Rimbolt brought him in from the library to have coffee in the drawing-room.  Jeffreys, aware that he was undergoing inspection, felt very shy and awkward, but could not quite do away with the improvement, or conceal that, despite his ugly face and ungainly figure there was something of the gentleman about him.  Mrs Rimbolt by no means approved of her husband bringing his librarian into the drawing-room.  She considered it a slight to herself and dangerous to Percy and Raby to have this person added to their family circle; and she most conscientiously made a point of lessening that danger on every occasion, by reminding him of his place and rendering his temporary visits to exalted latitudes as uncomfortable as possible. Mr Rimbolt, good easy-going gentleman, shrugged his shoulders and felt powerless to interfere, and when, after a week or two, his librarian generally pleaded some pressing work as an excuse for not going in to coffee, he understood it quite well and did not urge the invitation.  Percy, however, had a very different way of comporting himself.  What he liked he liked; what he did not like he most conveniently ignored.  He was anything but a model son, as the reader has discovered.  He loved his parents, indeed, but he sadly lacked that great ornament of youth--a dutiful spirit.  He was spoiled, and got his own way in everything.  He ruled Wildtree Towers, in fact.  If his mother desired him to do what he did not like, he was for the time being deaf, and did not hear her.  If he himself was overtaken in a fault, he changed the subject and talked cheerily about something else.  If one of his great ""dodges"" came to a ridiculous end, he promptly screened it from observation by a new one.  From the day of the kidnapping adventure he was a sworn ally of Jeffreys.  It mattered nothing to him who else snubbed the new librarian, or who else made his life uncomfortable.  Percy liked him and thought much of him.  He established a claim on his afternoons, in spite of Mrs Rimbolt's protests and Mr Rimbolt's arrangements.  Even Jeffreys' refusal to quit work at his bidding counted for nothing.  He represented to his mother that Jeffreys was necessary to his safety abroad, and to his father that Jeffreys would be knocked up if he did not take regular daily exercise.  He skilfully hinted that Jeffreys read Aeschylus with him sometimes; and once, as a crowning argument, produced a complete ""dodge,"" perfected and mechanically clever, ""which,"" he asserted, ""Jeff made me stick to till I'd done.""  Mr Rimbolt did not conceal the satisfaction with which he noticed the good influence on the boy of his new friend, and readily fell in with the arrangement that Jeffreys' afternoons should be placed at his own (which meant Percy's) disposal.  As for Mrs Rimbolt, she groaned to think of her boy consorting with quondam tramps, yet consoled herself with the knowledge that Percy had now some one who would look after him and keep him out of danger, even with a vulgar right arm.  Jeffreys accepted this new responsibility cheerfully, and even eagerly. It sometimes came over him with a shock, what would these people say if they knew about young Forrester?  Yet was not this care of a boy given to him now as a means, if not of winning back his good name, at least of atoning in some measure by the good he would try to do him, and the patience with which he would bear with his exacting ways for what was past?  It was in that spirit he accepted the trust, and felt happy in it.  As the summer passed on, Wildtree, the moors around which were famous for their game, became full of visitors.  The invasion did not disturb Jeffreys, for he felt that he would be able to retire into private life and avoid it.  The company numbered a few boys of Percy's age, so that even that young gentleman would not be likely to require his services for a while.  He therefore threw himself wholly into his work, and with the exception of an hour each afternoon, when he took a turn on the hill-side, showed himself to no one.  On one of these occasions, as he was strolling through the park towards the moor, he encountered Miss Atherton, very much laden with a camp- stool, a basket, a parasol, and a waterproof.  Shy as he was, Jeffreys could hardly pass her without offering to relieve her of part of her burden.  ""May I carry some of those things?"" said he.  He had scarcely exchanged words with Raby since the day of his first arrival; and though he secretly numbered her among his friends, he had an uncomfortable suspicion that she looked down on him, and made an effort to be kind to him.  ""Thanks, very much,"" said she, really glad to get rid of some of her burdens; ""if you wouldn't mind taking the chair.  But I'm afraid you are going the other way.""  ""No,"" said Jeffreys, taking the chair, ""I was going nowhere in particular.  May I not take the waterproof and basket too?""  ""The basket is far too precious,"" said Raby, smiling; ""it has grapes in it.  But if you will take this horrid waterproof--""  ""There is not much use for waterproofs this beautiful weather,"" said Jeffreys, beginning to walk beside her.  Then, suddenly recollecting himself, with a vision of Mrs Rimbolt before his mind, he fell back, and said awkwardly,--  ""Perhaps I had better--I must not detain you, Miss Atherton.""  She saw through him at once, and laughed.  ""You propose to follow me with those things as if I was an Eastern princess!  Perhaps I had better carry them myself if you are afraid of me.""  ""I'm not afraid of you,"" said Jeffreys.  ""But you are afraid of auntie.  So am I--I hope she'll meet us.  What were you saying about the weather, Mr Jeffreys?""  Jeffreys glanced in alarm at his audacious companion.  He had nothing for it after this challenge but to walk with her and brave the consequences.  There was something in her half-mutinous, half-confiding manner which rather interested him, and made the risk he was now running rather exhilarating.  ""Percy seems to have forsaken you,"" said she, after a pause, ""since his friends came.  I suppose he is sure to be blowing his brains out or something of the sort on the moors.""  ""Percy is a fine fellow, and certainly has some brains to blow,"" observed Jeffreys solemnly.  Raby laughed.  ""He's quite a reformed character since you came,"" said she; ""I'm jealous of you!""  ""Why?""  ""Oh, he cuts me, now he has you!  He used about once a week to offer to show me what he was doing.  Now he only offers once a month, and then always thinks better of it.""  ""The thing is to get him to work at one thing at a time,"" said Jeffreys, to whom Percy was always an interesting study.  ""As soon as he has learned that art he will do great things.""  ""I think Percy would make a fine soldier,"" said Raby, with an enthusiasm which quite captivated her companion, ""he's so brave and honest and determined.  Isn't he?""  ""Yes, and clever too.""  ""Of course; but my father always says a man needn't be clever to be a good soldier.  He says the clever soldiers are the least valuable.""  ""Was your father a soldier?""  ""Was?  He is.  He's in Afghanistan now.""  ""In the middle of all the fighting?""  ""Yes,"" said Raby, with a shade across her bright face.  ""It's terrible, isn't it?  I half dread every time I see a letter or a newspaper.  Mr Jeffreys!"" added the girl, stopping short in her walk, ""my father is the best and bravest man that ever lived.""  ""I know he is,"" said Jeffreys, beginning to wonder whether some of the father's good qualities were not hereditary.  Raby looked up curiously and then laughed.  ""You judge of him by seeing how heroic I am braving my aunt's wrath!  Oh dear, I do hope she meets us.  It would be such a waste of courage if she doesn't.""  ""I have benefited by your courage,"" said Jeffreys, quite staggered at his own gallantry.  ""I expect you're awfully dull in that old library,"" said the girl; ""you should hear how uncle praises you behind your back!  Poor auntie--""  At that moment they turned a corner of the shrubbery leading up to the house, and found themselves suddenly face to face with Mrs Rimbolt with a gentleman and two or three of her lady guests.  Jeffreys flushed up as guiltily as if he had been detected in a highway robbery, and absolutely forgot to salute.  Even Raby, who was not at all sure that her aunt had not overheard their last words, was taken aback and looked confused. Mrs Rimbolt bridled up like a cat going into action.  She took in the situation at a glance, and drew her own inferences.  ""Raby, my dear,"" said she, ""come with us.  Colonel Brotherton wishes to see Rodnet Force, and we are going there.  Oh, Mr Jeffreys,"" added she, turning frigidly upon the already laden librarian, ""when you have carried Miss Atherton's things into the house, be good enough to go to Kennedy and tell him to meet us at the Upper Fall.  And you will find some letters on the hall table to be posted.  By-the-way, Colonel Brotherton, if you have that telegram you want to send off, the librarian will go with it.  It is a pity you should have the walk.""  To these miscellaneous orders Jeffreys bowed solemnly, and did not fail to exhibit his clumsiness by dropping Raby's waterproof in a belated effort to raise his hat.  Mrs Rimbolt would hardly have been appeased had he not done so; and it was probably in a final endeavour to show him off as he departed that she added,--  ""Raby, give Mr Jeffreys that basket to take in; you cannot carry that up to the Falls.""  ""Oh, aunt, I've told Mr Jeffreys I can't trust him with it.  It has grapes in it.  Didn't I, Mr Jeffreys?"" she said, appealing gaily to him with a smile which seemed to make a man of him once more.  ""I will undertake not to eat them,"" said he, with a twitch of his mouth, receiving the precious basket.  After that he sacrificed even his afternoon constitutionals, and took to the life of a hermit until Wildtree Towers should be rid of its visitors.  But even so he could not be quite safe.  Percy occasionally hunted him out and demanded his company with himself and a few choice spirits on some hare-brained expedition.  Jeffreys did not object to Percy or the hare-brained expedition; but the ""choice spirits"" sometimes discomposed him.  They called him ""Jeffy,"" and treated him like some favoured domestic animal.  They recognised him as a sort of custodian of Percy, and on that account showed off before him, and demonstrated to Percy that he was no custodian of theirs.  They freely discussed his ugliness and poverty within earshot.  They patronised him without stint, and made a display of their own affluence in his presence.  And when once or twice he put down his foot and interdicted some illegal proceeding, they blustered rudely, and advised Percy to get the cad dismissed.  It was like some of the old Bolsover days back again, only with the difference that now he steeled himself to endure all patiently for young Forrester's sake.  It disappointed him to see Percy, led away by his company, sometimes lift his heel against him; yet it suited his humour to think it was only right, and a part of his penance, it should be so. Percy's revolt, to do that youth justice, was short-lived and speedily repented of.  As soon as his friends were gone he returned to Jeffreys with all his old allegiance, and showed his remorse by forgetting all about his recent conduct.  Perhaps the most trying incident in all that trying time to Jeffreys was what occurred on the last day of the Brothertons' visit.  The colonel and his family had been so busy seeing the natural beauties of Wildtree, that, till their visit was drawing to an end, they found they had scarcely done justice to the beautiful house itself, and what it contained.  Consequently the last evening was spent in a visit _en masse_ to the library where Jeffreys was duly summoned to assist Mr Rimbolt in exhibiting the treasures it contained.  As usual when the lady of the house was of the party, the librarian went through his work awkwardly.  He answered her questions in a confused manner, and contrived to knock over one or two books in his endeavour to reach down others.  He was conscious that some of the company were including him among the curiosities of the place, and that Mr Rimbolt himself was disappointed with the result of the exhibition.  He struggled hard to pull himself together, and in a measure succeeded before the visit was over, thanks chiefly to Mrs Rimbolt's temporary absence from the library.  The lady returned to announce that coffee was ready in the drawing-room, and Jeffreys, with a sigh of relief, witnessed a general movement towards the door.  He was standing rather dismally near the table, counting the seconds till he should be left alone, when Mrs Brotherton advanced to him with outstretched hand.  Imagining she was about to wish him good-evening in a more friendly manner than he had expected, he advanced his own hand, when, to his horror and dismay, he felt a half-crown dropped into it, with the half-whispered remark, ""We are much obliged to you.""  He was too staggered to do anything but drop his jaw and stare at the coin until the last of the party had filed from the room, not even observing the look of droll sympathy which Raby, the last to depart, darted at him.  Left to himself, one of his now rare fits of temper broke over him.  He stormed out of the place and up into his room, where, after flinging the coin into the grate, he paced up and down the floor like an infuriated animal.  Then by a sudden impulse he picked the coin up, and opening a toolbox which he kept in the room, he took from it a hammer and bradawl. Two or three vicious blows sufficed to make a hole in the centre of the Queen's countenance.  Then with a brass-headed nail he pinned the miscreant piece of silver to the wall above the mantelpiece, and sat looking at it till the storm was over.  It was a week or two before he quite recovered from this shock and settled down again to the ordinary routine of his life at Wildtree Towers.  As the afternoons became shorter, and out-of-door occupations in consequence became limited, he found Percy unexpectedly amenable to a quiet course of study, which greatly improved the tone of that versatile young gentleman's mind.  Percy still resolutely set his face against a return to school, and offered no encouragement to his perplexed parents in their various schemes for the advancement of his education. Consequently they were fain to be thankful, until some light dawned on the question, that his education was not being wholly neglected, and Mr Rimbolt in particular recognised that under Jeffreys' influence and tuition the boy was improving in more ways than one.  The autumn passed uneventfully.  Mr Rimbolt had occasion once or twice to go up to London, and on these occasions Jeffreys was reminded that he was not on a bed of roses at Wildtree.  But that half-crown over the mantelpiece helped him wonderfully.  Raby continued to regard him from a distance with a friendly eye, and now and then alarmed him by challenging him to some daring act of mutiny which was sure to end in confusion, but which, for all that, always seemed to him to have some compensation in the fellow-feeling it established between the poor librarian and the dependent and kept-under niece.  News arrived now and then from India, bringing relief as to what was past, but by no means allaying anxiety as to what might be in store for the soldier there.  A week before Christmas, Raby told Jeffreys, with mingled pride and trepidation, that her father had written to say he had been made major, and expected to be sent in charge of a small advance force towards Kandahar, to clear the way for a general advance.  By the same post another letter came for Mrs Rimbolt, the contents of which, as the Fates would have it, also came to Jeffreys' ears.  ""My dear,"" said the lady, entering the library that evening, letter in hand, and addressing her husband, who was just then engaged with his librarian in inspecting some new purchases, ""here is a letter from my old friend Louisa Scarfe.  She proposes to come to us for Christmas, and bring with her her son, who is now at Oxford.  I suppose I can write and say Yes?""  ""Certainly,"" said Mr Rimbolt; ""I shall be delighted.""  A chill went to Jeffreys' heart as he overheard this hurried consultation.  If this should be the Scarfe he knew, he was not yet rid, he felt, of Bolsover or of his bad name.    CHAPTER FIFTEEN.  FALLEN IN A HOLE.  Mrs Scarfe and her son arrived a day or two later at Wildtree Towers. Jeffreys, who from the recesses of a bay window was an unseen witness of the arrival, saw at a glance that his forebodings were too true.  Scarfe had changed somewhat since we saw him at Bolsover fifteen months ago. He was older and better-looking and wore a trim black moustache.  His dress was in the best Oxford style; and in his easy, confident carriage there remained no trace of the overgrown schoolboy.  His mother, a delicate-looking widow lady, returned Mrs Rimbolt's greeting with the eagerness of an old friend, and introduced her son with evident pride.  It was hopeless for Jeffreys to think of avoiding a recognition for long.  Still, he anxiously put off the evil hour as long as possible. The first afternoon and evening this was not difficult, for the travellers had made a long journey and retired early.  The following day he went through his work on tenterhooks.  Every time the library door opened he felt his heart sink within him, and every footstep he heard crossing the hall seemed to be the one he dreaded.  In the evening he attempted to escape the inevitable by taking refuge in his room after dinner.  But as it happened a messenger arrived from Overstone with a parcel of books, which made it necessary for him to return to the library.  And while there Mr Rimbolt as usual came in.  As soon as the business matter had been arranged Mr Rimbolt said, ""Miss Atherton has been asking to see Blake's _Songs of Innocence_, Jeffreys; will you kindly take the book to her in the drawing-room?  I have one of my tenants to see here, but I shall be in shortly.""  There was no possible escape from this dilemma.  With a groan he got the book down from its place and went.  Scarfe, as he entered the drawing-room, was engaged in turning over a book of prints with Raby, and did not notice him.  Nor did Mrs Rimbolt, siting on the sofa beside her friend, heed his entrance till Percy said,--  ""Hullo, Jeff!""  Jeffreys became aware that the eyes of the whole party were suddenly centred on him--Mrs Rimbolt's from under lifted eyebrows, Mrs Scarfe's through raised eye-glasses, Raby's with a veiled welcome, Scarfe's in blank astonishment.  He advanced awkwardly into the room.  ""Close the door, please, Mr Jeffreys,"" said Mrs Rimbolt, in tones which left no manner of doubt in her visitors' minds as to the status of the librarian in the house.  Jeffreys obeyed, and advanced once more towards Raby.  ""Your uncle,"" stammered he, conscious of nothing but Scarfe's stare, ""asked me to bring you this book.""  Then, turning with a desperate effort to his old schoolfellow, he said, ""How are you, Scarfe?""  He scorned himself for the half-appealing tone in which the salutation was made.  What was Scarfe to him?  Nothing, save that Scarfe and he had both looked down that October afternoon on the motionless form of one small boy in the Bolsover meadow.  And was that nothing?  ""How do you do, Jeffreys?"" said Scarfe, stiffly extending his hand, and immediately afterwards returning to his examination of the prints with Raby.  ""Do you know Jeff?"" asked Percy, who had witnessed the recognition.  ""Yes.  Jeffreys and I have met,"" said Scarfe, not looking up from his book.  ""Who is that young man?"" said Mrs Scarfe, in an audible whisper to her hostess.  ""The librarian here.  Mr Jeffreys,"" added Mrs Rimbolt, as Jeffreys stood irresolute, not knowing whether to remain in the room or go, ""be good enough to tell Walker he can bring the coffee, and tell Mr Rimbolt we are expecting him.""  ""Mr Rimbolt asked me to say you are not to wait coffee for him.  He may be detained with a tenant in the library.""  ""Jeff, I say, you should have been with us this afternoon.  We had such larks.  We got one or two pot shots, but didn't hit anything except the dog.  So it's a good job we didn't borrow Julius.  Kennedy says we're in for a ripping frost, so save yourself up, old man.""  ""Percy, you talk like a stable-boy.  Do remember you are in the drawing- room; and don't detain Mr Jeffreys from his work.""  Under cover of this maternal exhortation Jeffreys withdrew.  ""Rum your knowing Jeff, Scarfe!"" said Percy, after he had gone; ""was he at Oxford?""  ""No,"" said Scarfe.  ""It was at school.  Surely that must be one of Hogarth's engravings, Miss Atherton, it is exactly his style.""  ""It wasn't much of a school, was it?"" persisted Percy.  ""Jeff told me he didn't care about it.""  ""I don't think he did,"" replied Scarfe with a faint smile.  ""I suppose you are very fond of Oxford, are you not?"" said Mrs Rimbolt; ""every one who belongs to the University seems very proud of it.""  This effectually turned the conversation away from Jeffreys, and the subject was not recurred to that evening, except just when Scarfe was bidding his mother good-night in her boudoir.  ""I hope you won't be dull here,"" said she.  ""Miss Atherton seems a pleasant girl, but it is a pity Percy is not older and more of a companion.""  ""Oh, I shall enjoy myself,"" said Scarfe.  ""You don't seem very fond of that Mr Jeffreys.""  ""No, I draw the line somewhere, mother,"" said the son.  ""What do you mean?  Is there anything discreditable about him?  He looks common and stupid, to be sure.  Mrs Rimbolt tells me Percy is greatly taken up with him.""  ""They appear to have curious ideas about the kind of companion they choose for their boy,"" said Scarfe.  ""But it's no business of ours. Good-night, mother.""  And he went, leaving Mrs Scarfe decidedly mystified.  Jeffreys and Scarfe occasionally met during the next few days.  Jeffreys was rather relieved to find that his late schoolfellow seemed by no means anxious to recall an old acquaintance or to refer to Bolsover.  He could even forgive him for falling into the usual mode of treating the librarian as an inferior.  It mattered little enough to him, seeing what Scarfe already knew about him, what he thought of him at Wildtree.  On the whole, the less they met and the less they talked together, the less chance was there of rousing bitter memories.  The Scarfes would hardly remain more than a month.  If for that time he could efface himself, the danger might blow over, and he might be left at the end of the time with the secret of his bad name still safe at Wildtree Towers.  Kennedy's prophecy of a hard frost turned out to have been a knowing one.  All through Christmas week it continued with a severity rare even in that mountainous region; and when on New Year's Day the report reached Wildtree that a man had skated across the upper end of Wellmere it was admitted to be a frost which, to the younger generation of the place at least, ""beat record.""  Percy was particularly enthusiastic, and terrified his mother by announcing that he meant to skate across Wellmere, too.  Raby, though less ambitious, was equally keen for the ice; and Scarfe, indolently inclined as he was, was constrained to declare himself also anxious to put on his skates.  A day was lost owing to the fact that Percy's skates, which had lain idle for two years, were now too small for him and useless.  Mrs Rimbolt devoutly hoped the ironmonger in Overstone would have none to fit him, and used the interval in intriguing right and left to stop the projected expedition.  She represented to her husband that the head gardener was of opinion that the frost had reached its height two days ago.  She discovered that Scarfe had a cold, to which exposure might be disastrous.  Raby she peremptorily forbade to dream of the ice; and as for Percy, she conjured him by the love he bore her to skate on nothing deeper than the Rodnet Marsh, whereat that young gentleman gibed.  The Overstone ironmonger had skates which fitted the boy to a nicety, and by way of business sent up ""on inspection"" a pair which Mr Rimbolt might find useful for himself.  ""You surely will not allow Percy to go?"" said the lady to her husband, on the morning after the arrival of the skates.  ""Why not?  He's a good skater, and we don't often have a frost.""  ""But on Wellmere!  Think of the danger!""  ""I often skated across Wellmere when I was a boy.  I would not object to do it again if I had the time to spare.  I declare the sight of the skates tempted me.""  ""I don't believe Mr Scarfe can swim.  What would happen if there were an accident?""  ""I think you overrate the danger,"" said her husband; ""however, if it pleases you, I will get Jeffreys to go with them.  He can swim, and I dare say he can skate, too.""  Mrs Rimbolt shied a little at the suggestion, but yielded to it as a compromise, being better than nothing.  Jeffreys would fain have evaded this unexpected service.  ""I have no skates,"" he said, when Mr Rimbolt proposed it.  ""Yes; the ironmonger sent up a pair for me, and as I can't use them you are welcome to them.""  ""Did you not want the books from Sotheby's collated before to-morrow?""  ""No, Saturday will do.  Honestly, Jeffreys, I would be more comfortable, so would Mrs Rimbolt, if you went.  We have experience of the care you take of Percy.  So, you see, I ask a favour.""  It was useless to hold out.  ""I will go,"" said he; and it was settled.  An hour later Scarfe, Percy, Jeffreys, and Julius stood at the hall door ready to start.  ""Where's Raby, I say?"" cried Percy; ""she said she'd come.""  ""I do not wish Raby to go.""  ""Oh, look here, mother, as if we couldn't look after her; eh, Scarfe?""  ""It will be no pleasure without Miss Atherton,"" said Scarfe.  ""Can't she come, father?"" said Percy, adroitly appealing to Caesar.  ""I really think it would be a pity she should miss the fun.""  ""Huzzah!  Raby, where are you?  Look sharp! father says you can come, and we're waiting!"" cried Percy.  Raby, who had been watching the party rather wistfully, did not keep them long waiting.  Wellmere was a large lake some five miles long and a mile across.  In times of frost it not unfrequently became partially frozen, but owing to the current of the river which passed through it, it seldom froze so completely as to allow of being traversed on skates.  This, however, was an extraordinary frost, and the feat of the adventurer on New Year's Day had been several times repeated already.  The Wildtree party found the ice in excellent order, and the exhilarating sensation of skimming over the glassy surface banished for the time all the unpleasant impressions of the walk.  It was several years since Jeffreys had worn skates, but he found that five minutes was sufficient to render him at home on the ice.  He eschewed figures, and devoted himself entirely to straightforward skating, which, as it happened, was all that Percy could accomplish--all, indeed, that he aspired too.  It therefore happened naturally that Scarfe and Raby, who cultivated the eccentricities of skating, were left to their own devices, while Jeffreys, accompanied of course by Julius, kept pace with his young hero for the distant shore.  It was a magnificent stretch.  The wind was dead, the ice was perfect, and their skates were true and sharp.  ""Isn't this grand?"" cried Percy, all aglow, as they scudded along, far outstripping the perplexed Julius.  ""Better than smoking cigarettes, eh, old Jeff?""  Jeffreys accepted this characteristic tender of reconciliation with a thankful smile.  ""I was never on such ice!"" said he.  ""Looks as if it couldn't thaw, doesn't it?"" said Percy.  ""It's better here in the middle than nearer the shore.  I hope those two won't get too near the river, it looks more shaky there.""  ""Trust Scarfe!  He knows what's what!  I say, aren't he and Raby spoons?""  ""Mind that log of wood.  It must be pretty shallow here,"" said Jeffreys, his face glowing with something more than the exercise.  They made a most successful crossing.  Returning, a slight breeze behind them favoured their progress, and poor Julius had a sterner chase than ever.  As they neared their starting-point Jeffreys looked about rather anxiously for Scarfe and Raby, who, tiring of their fancy skating, had started on a little excursion of their own out into the lake.  ""I wish they wouldn't go that way,"" said he, as he watched them skimming along hand-in-hand; ""it may be all right, but the current is sure to make the ice weaker than out here.""  ""Oh, they're all serene,"" said Percy.  ""I'll yell to them when we get near enough.""  Presently, as they themselves neared the shore, they noticed Scarfe turn and make for the land, evidently for something that had been forgotten, or else to make good some defect in his skates.  Raby, while waiting, amused herself with cutting some graceful figures and curvetting to and fro, but always, as Jeffreys noted with concern, edging nearer to the river.  Percy shouted and waved to her to come the other way.  She answered the call gaily and started towards them.  Almost as she started there was a crack, like the report of a gun, followed by a cry from the girl.  Jeffreys, with an exclamation of horror and a call to Julius, dashed in an instant towards her.  The light girlish figure, however, glided safely over the place of danger.  Jeffreys had just time to swerve and let her pass, and next moment he was struggling heavily twenty yards beyond in ten feet of icy water.  It all happened in a moment.  Percy's shout, the crack, the girl's cry, and Julius's wild howl, all seemed part of the same noise.  Percy, the first of the spectators to recover his self-possession, shouted to Scarfe, and started for the whole.  ""I'm all right, don't come nearer,"" called Jeffreys, as he approached; ""there's a ladder there, where Scarfe is.  Bring it.""  Percy darted off at a tangent, leaving Jeffreys, cool in body and mind, to await his return.  To an ordinarily excitable person, the position was a critical one.  The water was numbing; the ice at the edge of the hole was rotten, and broke away with every effort he made to climb on to it; even Julius, floundering beside him, bewildered, and at times a dead weight on his arms and neck, was embarrassing.  Jeffreys, however, did not exhaust himself by wild struggles.  He laid his stick across the corner of the hole where the ice seemed firmest, and with his arms upon it propped himself with tolerable security.  He ordered the dog out of the water and made him lie still at a little distance on the ice.  He even contrived to kick off one boot, skate and all, into the water, but was too numbed to rid himself of the other.  It seemed an eternity while Scarfe and Percy approached with the ladder, with Raby, terrified and pale, hovering behind.  ""Don't come nearer,"" he shouted, when at last they got within reach. ""Slide it along.""  They pushed it, and it slipped to within a yard of him.  Julius, who appeared to have mastered the situation, jumped forward, and fixing his teeth in the top rung, dragged it the remaining distance.  The remainder was easy.  Scarfe crawled along the ladder cautiously till within reach of the almost exhausted Jeffreys, and caught him under the shoulder, dragging him partially up.  ""I can hold now,"" said Jeffreys, ""if you and Percy will drag the ladder. Julius, hold me, and drag too.""  This combined effort succeeded.  A minute later, Jeffreys, numbed with cold but otherwise unhurt, was being escorted on his one skate between Percy and Scarfe for the shore, where Raby awaited him with a look that revived him as nothing else could.    CHAPTER SIXTEEN.  A BRUSH NEAR KANDAHAR.  While Raby that night dreamed troublously of the events of the day, a soldier was sitting in his tent near Kandahar, some four thousand or more miles away, reading a letter.  He was an officer; his sword lay beside him on the table, his boots were off, and a flannel coat took the place of the regimental jacket which lay beside his saddle on the floor. If these signs were not sufficient to prove that for the time being he was off duty, his attitude as he lolled back in his camp-chair, with his feet on the table considerably above the level of his chin, reading his letter by the uncertain light of a lamp, would have left little doubt on the subject.  So engrossed indeed was he that he was unaware of the presence of his native servant in the tent preparing supper, and read aloud to himself.  The envelope of the letter, which lay on the table, was a foreign one with an English stamp, and addressed in a feminine hand.  The soldier, having completed his first perusal, turned back to the beginning, reading partly to himself, partly aloud.  ""`October 4'--three months ago or more!--before she heard of this business.  `You poor dull darling'--nice names to call one's father, true enough, though, at the time, it was brutally dull at Simla--`I can fancy how you hate loafing about all day with nothing to do but try and keep cool and find a place to sleep in where the flies can't worry you.' Hum!  Picture of a soldier's life!  A little different from the usual impression, but not very wide of the mark after all.""  Then he read to himself for a bit something which made his weather- beaten face soften, and brought a sparkle to his eyes.  ""Bless the child!"" he murmured; ""she doesn't forget her old father! `How glad I shall be if you get sent to the front, for I know how you hate doing nothing.  If you are, I shall be foolish, of course, and imagine all sorts of horrors whenever I see a letter.'  That's the way girls back their fathers up!  `Oh, why couldn't I be a soldier too, and ride behind you into action, instead of dawdling here doing no good to anybody, and living like a fine young lady instead of a simple soldier's daughter?'  Whew! what a fine little colour-sergeant she'd make! Wouldn't Mrs Grundy sit up if she read that?  ""Hum!"" he went on, after reading a little further.  ""`I oughtn't to grumble.  Uncle Rimbolt is the kindest of protectors, and lets me have far too many nice things.  Aunt has a far better idea of what a captain's daughter should be.  She doesn't spoil me.  She's like a sort of animated extinguisher, and whenever I flicker up a bit she's down on me.  I enjoy it, and I think she is far better pleased that I give her something to do than if I was awfully meek.  It all helps to pass the time till my dear old captain comes home.'  Heigho! that means she's miserable, and I'm not to guess it!  I had my doubts of Charlotte Rimbolt when I let her go to Wildtree.  Poor little Raby! she's no match for an animated extinguisher!  ""`Percy,' continued the letter, `is as lively and full of ""dodges"" as ever.  He soon got over his kidnapping adventure.  Indeed, the only difference it has made is that we have now one, or rather two, new inmates at Wildtree, for Uncle Rimbolt has employed Percy's rescuer as his librarian, and the dog has, of course, taken up his abode here too. He is a perfect darling! so handsome and clever!  He took to me the first moment I saw him, and he would do anything for me.'  Really!"" said the father; ""that's coming it rather strong, isn't it, with the new librar-- Oh, perhaps she means the dog!  Ha, ha!  `Aunt Rimbolt gets some fine extinguisher practice with this newcomer, against whom she has a most unaccountable prejudice.  He is very shy and gentlemanly, but I am sure Percy never had a better friend.  He has become ever so much steadier.'  Did you ever know such letter-writers as these girls are? Which newcomer does she mean, the fellow who's a perfect darling, or the fellow who's shy and gentlemanly? and which, in the name of wonder, is the man and which the dog?  Upon my word, something awful might be going on, and I should be none the wiser!  `Julius nearly always escorts me in my walks.  He is _such_ a dear friendly fellow, and always carries my bag or parasol.  Aunt, of course, doesn't approve of our being so devoted to one another, for she looks upon Julius as an interloper; but it doesn't matter much to us.  Percy often comes with us, but Julius rather resents a third person.  He thinks--so do I, much as I like Percy--that two are company and three are none.'""  Major Atherton--for the soldier was no other--leaned back in his chair, and fanned himself with the letter.  ""How _on earth_ am I to know who or what she is talking about?  If it's not the dog, upon my honour, Aunt Rimbolt-- It can't be the dog, though. She calls him Julius; and why should she take the boy along with them if it wasn't the librarian puppy she walked with?  Rimbolt ought to look after things better than that!  ""`Uncle Rimbolt thinks very highly of his new _protege_.  He is so quiet; it is quite painful sometimes talking to him.  I'm sure he has had a lot of trouble; he has a sort of hunted look sometimes which is quite pathetic.  Aunt hardly ever lets him come into the drawing-room, and when she does it is generally in order to snub him.  I fancy he feels his anomalous position in this house very much.'""  ""My patience!  That's a mild way of putting it!"" exclaimed the major; ""the anomalous position of this hunted-looking, shy librarian who carries her parasol and escorts her about, and suggests to Percy that two are company and three are none!  All I can say is the sooner we get into Kandahar and are paid off home the better!""  ""What's that you're saying about Kandahar, old man?"" said a voice at the door of the tent, and there entered a handsome jaunty-looking officer of about Atherton's age.  ""That you, Forrester?  Come in.  I've just had a letter from my little girl.""  A shade crossed Captain Forrester's cheery face.  ""Your luck, my dear boy.  I haven't had a line.""  ""Perhaps there's a letter for you at head-quarters.""  ""I doubt it.  But don't talk about it.  How's your girl flourishing?""  ""Upon my honour, she seems to be a little too flourishing,"" said the major, taking up his letter with a look of puzzled concern.  ""You may be a better English scholar than I am, Forrester, and be able to make head or tail of this.  As far as I can make it out, Raby is flourishing very decidedly.  Here, read this second sheet.""  Captain Forrester took the letter, and read the part indicated carefully.  The major watched him anxiously till he had done.  ""Well?"" he asked, as his comrade handed it back.  ""It seems to be a case,"" said the latter.  ""That's what I thought.  I don't like that carrying her parasol, and telling the boy that two are company--""  Captain Forrester burst into a loud laugh.  ""Why, you glorious old donkey, that's the dog!""  ""Nonsense; she'd never say a dog was shy and gentlemanly, and looked as if he'd had a lot of trouble.""  ""No,"" said the captain holding his sides, ""that's the librarian.""  ""Who--the fellow Julius she talks about?"" asked the major, beginning to feel very warm.  ""The fellow Julius!  Why, Julius is the dog!""  The major rose from his seat in agitation, and stood before his friend.  ""Forrester,"" said he solemnly, ""as soon as I see the joke I'll laugh. Meanwhile tell me this.  Who in the name of mystery is it who feels his anomalous position at Wildtree, the man or the dog?""  Captain Forrester held gallantly on to his chair to prevent falling off; and the native without, hearing his shouts, looked in at the door to see what the sahib wanted.  ""My dear fellow,"" said he at last, ""I begin to think I know more than you.  Can't you see this daughter of yours is decidedly interested in this young _protege_ of her uncle?""  ""Most decidedly I see that.""  ""And that in order to throw dust in your fatherly old eyes, she makes a great gush about the dog Julius, and says hardly a word about the master, whose name does not appear.""  Major Atherton took up the letter again and glanced through it, and a light began to break on his puzzled countenance.  ""Then,"" said he, ""the fellow who's handsome and clever and a perfect darling is--""  ""Is the bow-wow.  And the fellow who's hunted-looking and not allowed in the drawing-room is his master.""  Major Atherton resumed his chair, and once more planted his feet on the table.  ""That is a way of putting it, certainly.  If so, it's a relief.""  ""My dear boy, keep your eye on that librarian, or he may change places with his dog in double-quick time.""  The major laughed, and a pause ensued.  Then Forrester said--  ""Two or three days more, and we ought to be in Kandahar.""  ""We are to have a stiff brush or two before we get there,"" said the major; ""any hour now may bring us to close quarters.""  There was another pause.  Captain Forrester fidgeted about uneasily, and presently said--  ""It's possible, old man, only one of us may get through.  If I am the one who is left behind, will you promise me something?""  ""You know I will.""  ""That boy of mine, Atherton, is somewhere, I'm as sure of it as that I'm sitting here.  He's vanished.  My letters to Grangerham cannot all have miscarried, and they certainly have none of them been answered.  My mother-in-law, as I told you, died in the south of England.  The boy may have been with her, or left behind in Grangerham, or he may be anywhere. I told you of the letter I had from the school?""  ""Yes; he had had an accident and gone home damaged--crippled, in fact.""  ""Yes,"" said Captain Forrester, with a groan, ""crippled--and perhaps left without a friend.""  ""You want me to promise to find him if you are not there to do it, and be a father to him.  You needn't ask it, old man, for I promise.""  ""I've nothing to leave him,"" said Captain Forrester, ""except my sword and this watch--""  ""And the good name of a gallant soldier.  I will, if it is left to me to do it, take the boy all three.""  ""Thanks, Atherton.  You know that I would do the same by you, old fellow.""  ""You may have the chance.  That girl of mine, you know,"" added the major, with a tremble in his voice, ""would have what little I have saved, which is not much.  She's a good girl, but she would need a protector if I was not there.""  ""She shall have it,"" said his friend.  ""I'm not sure that she's happy at Wildtree,"" continued the father, with a smile, ""despite the dog and his master.  Rimbolt's a bookworm, and doesn't see what goes on under his nose, and her aunt, as she says, is an animated extinguisher.  It always puzzled me how Rimbolt came to marry Charlotte Halgrove.""  ""Halgrove?  Was she the sister of your old college friend?""  ""Yes.  Rimbolt, Halgrove, and I were inseparable when we were at Oxford. Did I ever tell you of our walking tour in the Lakes?  We ruled a bee- line across the map with a ruler and walked along it, neck or nothing. Of course you know about it.  We've sobered down since then.  Rimbolt married Halgrove's sister, and I married Rimbolt's.  I had no sister, so Halgrove remained a bachelor.""  ""What became of him?""  ""I fancy he made a mess of it, poor fellow.  He went in for finance, and it was too much for him.  Not that he lost his money; but he became a little too smart.  He dropped a hundred or two of mine, and a good deal more of Rimbolt's--but he could spare it.  The last I heard of him was about twelve years ago.  He had a partner called Jeffreys; a stupid honest sort of fellow who believed in him.  I had a newspaper sent me with an account of an inquest on poor Jeffreys, who had gone out of his mind after some heavy losses.  There was no special reason to connect Halgrove with the losses, except that Jeffreys would never have dreamed of speculating if he hadn't been led on.  And it's only fair to Halgrove to say that after the event he offered to take charge of Jeffreys' boy, at that time eight years old.  That shows there was some good in him.""  ""Unless,"" suggested Captain Forrester, ""there was some money along with the boy.""  ""Well, I dare say if he's alive still, Rimbolt will know something of him; so I may come across him yet,"" said the major; and there the conversation ended.  Major Atherton's prophecy of a brush with the enemy was not long in being fulfilled.  Early next day the expeditionary force was ordered forward, the cavalry regiment in which the two friends were officers being sent ahead to reconnoitre and clear the passes.  The march lay for some distance along a rocky valley, almost desolate of habitations, and at parts so cumbered with rocks and stones as to be scarcely passable by the horses, still less by the artillery, which struggled forward in front of the main body.  The rocks on the right bank towered to a vast height, breaking here and there into a gorge which admitted some mountain stream down into the river below, and less frequently falling back to make way for a wild saddle-back pass into the plains above.  Along such a course every step was perilous, for the enemy had already been reported as hovering at the back of these ugly rocks, and might show their teeth at any moment.  For an hour or two, however, the march continued uninterrupted.  The few scattered Afghans who had appeared for a moment on the heights above had fallen back after exchanging shots, with no attempt at serious resistance.  The main body had been halted in the valley, awaiting the return of the scouts.  The horses had been unharnessed from the guns, and the officers were snatching a hurried meal, when Captain Forrester at the head of a few troopers scampered into the lines.  The news instantly spread that the enemy had been seen ahead, and was even then being chased by the cavalry up one of the defiles to the right.  Instantly, and without even waiting for the word of command, every man was in his place ready to go on.  The guns, with Captain Forrester's troop as escort, dashed forward to hold the defile; while the main body, divided into two divisions--one to follow the guns, the other to reach the plain above by a nearer pass--started forward into action.  The cavalry, meanwhile, with Major Atherton at their head, were already engaged in a hot scrimmage.  Following their usual tactics, the Afghans, after exchanging shots at the entrance of the pass, had turned tail and dashed through the defile, with the English at their heels.  Then, suddenly turning as they reached the plain beyond, they faced round on their pursuers, not yet clear of the rocky gorge.  In the present instance, however, when within about a hundred yards of the head of the column, they wheeled round again, and once more bolted into the open.  A stern chase ensued over the rough broken ground, the enemy now and then making a show of halting, but as often giving way and tempting the cavalry farther out into the plain.  The Afghans numbered only about two hundred horsemen, but it was quite evident from their tactics that they had a much larger body in reserve, and Major Atherton was decidedly perplexed as to what he should do.  For if he pursued them too far, he might be cut off from his own men; if, on the other hand, he made a dash and rode them down before they could get clear, he might cut them off from their main body, and so clip the enemy's wings.  The enemy settled the question for him.  Just as he was looking round for the first sign of Forrester and the guns in the pass, the plain suddenly swarmed with Afghans.  From every quarter they bore down on him, horse and foot, and even guns, seeming almost to spring, like the teeth of Cadmus, from the earth.  It was no time for hesitation or doubt.  Retreat was out of the question.  Equally hopeless was it to warn the troops who were coming up.  There was nothing for it but to stand at bay till the main body came up, and then, if they were left to do it, fight their way out and join forces.  The major therefore brought his men to a corner of the rocks, where on two sides, at any rate, attack would be difficult; and there, ordering them to dismount and form square, stood grimly.  A cruel half-hour followed.  Man after man of that little band went down before the dropping fire of the enemy.  Had the guns been able to command the position, they would have fallen by tens and scores.  Major Atherton, in the middle of the square, had his horse shot under him before five minutes were past.  Alas! there was no lack of empty saddles to supply the loss, for before a quarter of an hour had gone by, out of a dozen officers scarcely half remained.  Still they stood, waiting for the first boom of the guns at the head of the pass, and often tempted to break away from their posts and die fighting.  For of all a soldier's duties, that of standing still under fire is the hardest.  Captain Forrester, dashing up the defile at the head of the artillery, had been prepared to find a lively skirmish in progress between his own comrades and the handful of Afghans who were luring them on.  But when, on emerging on to the plain, he found himself and the guns more than half surrounded by the enemy, and no sign anywhere of Atherton, he felt that the ""brush"" was likely to be a very stiff one.  The Afghans had set their hearts on those guns; that was evident by the wild triumphant yell with which they charged down on them.  Forrester had barely time to order a halt and swing the foremost gun into action when a pell-mell scrimmage was going on in the very midst of the gunners.  The first shot fired wildly did little or no execution, but it warned Atherton that his time was come, and signalled to the troops still toiling up the pass what to expect when they got through.  That fight round the guns was the most desperate of the day.  The Afghans knew that to capture them as they stood, meant the certain annihilation of the British troops as they defiled into the plain. Forrester knew it, too.  Unlike Atherton, he had no protected sides.  The enemy was all round him.  The little troop at his command was barely able to cover one side of the square; and the gunners, obliged to fight hand to hand where they stood, were powerless to advance a step.  Every moment was golden. Already a distant bugle-note announced that Atherton's horse had broken loose, and were somewhere within reach--probably cutting their way through the guns.  And within a few minutes the head of the column ascending the defile would also come upon the scene.  Hold the guns till then, and all might yet be safe.  So decided Captain Forrester, as with a cheery smile on his handsome face he shouted to his men to hold out, and fought like a lion beside the foremost gun.  The Afghans, baffled by the stubborn resistance, and aware of the danger of delay, hurled themselves upon that devoted little bond with a fury before which nothing could stand.  Man after man dropped across his gun; but still Forrester shouted to his men and swung his sabre.  It was no time for counting heads.  He hardly knew whether, when he shouted, thirty, or twenty, or only ten shouted back.  All he knew was the enemy had not got the guns yet, and that was sufficient!  A bugle!  Five minutes more, and they might still laugh at the foe.  The bugle-note came from Atherton's men, who at the first sound of the gun had vaulted with a cheer to their horses and dashed towards the sound. Many a brave comrade they left behind them, and many more dropped right and left as they cut their way forward.  Atherton, at their head, peered eagerly through the dust and smoke.  All he could see was a surging mass of human beings, in the midst of which it was impossible to discern anything but the flash of sabres, and at one spot a few British helmets among the turbans of the enemy.  That was enough for Major Atherton. Towards that spot he waved on his men, and ordered his bugler to sound a rousing signal.  The bugler obeyed, and fell at the major's side before the note had well ceased!  The struggle round the guns increased and blackened.  One after another the British helmets went down, and the wild shouts of the Afghans rose triumphantly above them.  At length Atherton saw a tall figure, bareheaded and black with smoke, spring upon a gun-carriage, and with the butt end of a carbine fell two or three of the enemy who scrambled up to dislodge him.  Atherton knew that form among a thousand, and he knew too that Forrester was making his last stand.  ""Cheer, men, and come on!"" cried he to his men, rising in his stirrups and leading the shout.  The head of the column, just then emerging from the gorge, heard that shout, and answered it with a bugle flourish, as they fixed bayonets and rushed forward to charge.  At the same moment, a cheer and the boom of a gun on the left proclaimed that the other half of the column had at that moment reached the plain, and were also bearing down on the enemy's flank.  But Atherton saw and heeded nothing but that tall heroic figure on the carriage.  At the first sound of the troopers' shout Forrester had turned his head, smiling, and raised his carbine aloft, as though to wave answer to the cheer.  So he stood for a moment.  Then he reeled and fell back upon the gun he had saved.    CHAPTER SEVENTEEN.  AN OFFICIAL REPORT.  Scarfe, on the return of the skating party to Wildtree, found himself the hero of the hour.  Whether the risk he ran in rescuing his old schoolfellow from his icy bath had been great or small, it had resulted in saving Jeffreys' life, and that was quite sufficient to make a hero of him.  Percy, easily impressed by the daring of any one else, and quite overlooking his own share in the rescue, was loud in his praises.  ""How jolly proud you must feel!"" said he.  ""I know I should if I'd saved a fellow's life.  That's never my luck!""  ""You lent a hand,"" said Scarfe, with the complacency of one who can afford to be modest.  And, to do Scarfe justice, until he heard himself credited with the lion's share of the rescue, he had been a little doubtful in his own mind as to how much of it he might justly claim.  ""Oh,"" said Percy, ""a lot I did!  You might as well say Raby lent a hand by lending Jeff her shawl.""  ""I was the cause of it all,"" said Raby.  ""But you forget dear old Julius; I'm sure he lent a hand.""  ""The dog was rather in the way than otherwise,"" said Scarfe; ""dogs always are on the ice.""  Jeffreys, as he walked silently beside them, could afford to smile at this last remark.  But in other respects he found little cause for smiling.  He was not yet a purified being, and even the peril he had been in had not cast out the fires of pride and temper that lurked within him.  It now stung him with an unspeakable misery to find that he was supposed to owe his life to one whom he so thoroughly mistrusted and dreaded as Scarfe.  He persuaded himself that it was all a delusion--that he could easily have extricated himself without anybody's aid but that of the faithful Julius; that Scarfe had run absolutely no risk in crawling out to him on the ladder; that, in short, he owed him nothing--if, indeed, he did not owe him resentment for allowing himself to be credited with a service which he had no right to claim.  Ungrateful and unreasonable, you will say, and certainly not betokening a proper spirit in one so recently in great danger.  Jeffreys, as he walked moodily along, was neither in a grateful nor reasonable mood, nor did he feel chastened in spirit; and that being so, he was too honest to pretend to be what he was not.  To any one less interested, there was something amusing in the manner in which Scarfe took his new and unexpected glory.  At first he seemed to regard it doubtfully, and combated it by one or two modest protestations.  Then, becoming more used to the idea, it pleased him to talk a little about the adventure, and encourage the others to recall the scene.  After that it seemed natural to him to be a little languid and done-up by his exertions, and, as a hero, to establish a claim on Raby's admiration.  And finally, being quite convinced he was a hero of the first water, he regarded Jeffreys with condescension, and felt a little surprise that he should remain both silent and apparently disdainful.  As Raby was beforehand with her in blaming herself, the wind was taken out of Mrs Rimbolt's sails in that quarter, even had she been disposed to let out in that direction.  But it was so much more convenient and natural to blame Jeffreys, that the good lady was never in a moment's doubt upon the subject.  ""How excessively careless of him!"" said she; ""the very one of the party, too, whom we expected to keep out of danger.  It is a mercy every one of you was not drowned.""  ""It's a mercy he wasn't drowned himself,"" said Percy; ""so he would have been if it hadn't been for Scarfe.""  ""It was a very noble thing of Mr Scarfe,"" said Mrs Rimbolt.  ""I'm sure, Louisa, my dear, you must be proud of your boy.""  ""He jolly well deserves a Royal Humane medal, and I mean to write and get him one.""  ""Don't be a young duffer,"" said the hero, by no means displeased at the threat; ""they would laugh at the notion.""  ""Would they?  If they didn't give you one, we'd make them laugh on the wrong side of their faces.  I know that,"" replied the boy.  ""You know, auntie, it was I broke the ice,"" said Raby.  ""Mr Jeffreys did not come to that part till he heard it crack.""  ""That is the ridiculously foolish part of it; he might have known that he ought to keep off when he heard it crack.  Any sensible person would.""  ""Perhaps,"" said Raby, colouring, ""he imagined I was in danger.""  ""You are a foolish child, Raby, to talk such nonsense, and should be thankful it was not you who fell in.  I hope, Mr Scarfe,"" added she, ""that Mr Jeffreys is grateful to you for your heroic service to him.""  ""There is nothing to be grateful for,"" said Scarfe, in an off-hand way; ""indeed, I am afraid Jeffreys is rather offended with me for what I have done than otherwise.""  ""He could not be so base, my boy,"" said his mother, ""when he owes you his life.""  ""After all,"" said Scarfe, with interesting resignation, ""it really does not matter.  All I know is, if it were all to happen over again I should do just the same thing.""  With which noble sentiment the hero was borne off to his room, where a hot bath, warm clothing, a rousing fire, and steaming cordials somewhat consoled him for his self-sacrificing exertions.  After dinner Mrs Rimbolt could not resist the gratification of seeing honour done to her guest by the object of his devotion; a project which was the more easy of accomplishment as Mr Rimbolt was from home on that particular evening.  Jeffreys, just beginning to recover himself by the aid of a little hard work, was petrified by Walker's announcement that ""the mistress desired that Mr Jeffreys would step into the drawing-room.""  His good breeding was sorely taxed to find an excuse.  He was indisposed, certainly; but if he could work in the library, he could bow and scrape in the drawing-room.  Mr Rimbolt, too, was away, and to insult his lady in his absence seemed both cowardly and mean.  ""I'll come presently,"" said he to Walker, and nerved himself desperately for the ordeal.  For he knew what was coming, and was resolved on the part he would play. Whatever he ought to feel, he knew exactly what he did feel; and he was determined he would not be hypocrite enough to pretend anything more.  Whereupon he walked defiantly forth and opened the drawing-room door, this time without knocking.  ""Mr Jeffreys,"" said Mrs Rimbolt, feeling that the present was an ""occasion,"" and worked up accordingly, ""I have sent for you, as I have no doubt you will wish to express to Mrs Scarfe the feelings you entertain with regard to her son's brave conduct on the ice to-day.""  ""Hear, hear, ma!"" cried the irreverent Percy, with mock-heroic applause. ""I beg leave to second that.""  ""Percy, be silent, sir!  Louisa, my dear, this is Mr Jeffreys, whose life your son saved.""  Mrs Scarfe put up her glasses and inclined her head languidly in response to Jeffreys' stiff bow.  An awkward silence ensued--so awkward that Percy began to whistle.  Mrs Rimbolt having made a wrong start, had not the tact to mend matters.  ""Mrs Scarfe would be interested to hear, Mr Jeffreys,"" said she, after a minute or two, ""your impressions of the accident.""  ""The only impression I had,"" said Jeffreys solemnly--and he too was worked up, and the master of his nervousness--""was that the water was very cold.""  Percy greeted this with a boisterous laugh, which his mother instantly rebuked.  ""Surely, Mr Jeffreys,"" said she severely, ""this is hardly an occasion for a joke.""  ""It was no joke,"" replied he with dismal emphasis.  Again Percy enjoyed the sport.  ""I should rather think it wasn't by the looks of you when you were fished out!"" said he; ""you were as blue as salmon!""  ""Percy, cease your vulgar talk in this room, please!"" said Mrs Rimbolt, whose equanimity was beginning to evaporate.  ""Mr Jeffreys, as we are not likely to be amused by your levity--""  ""Excuse me, madam, I am quite serious,"" said Jeffreys, on whom the apparent jocularity of his last remark had suddenly dawned; ""I had no intention of being rude, or treating your question as a joke.""  ""Then,"" said Mrs Rimbolt, slightly appeased in the prospect of gaining her object, ""when I tell you Mrs Scarfe is kind enough to desire to hear about the accident from your own lips, perhaps your good manners will permit you to tell her about it.""  ""Get upon the chair and give us a speech, Jeff,"" said the irrepressible Percy; ""that's what ma wants.""  Jeffreys proceeded to give his version of the affair, distributing the credit of his rescue in the order in which he considered it to be due, and greatly disappointing both Mrs Rimbolt and her guest by his evident blindness to the heroism of Scarfe.  He acknowledged warmly Percy's readiness to come to his help, and his promptitude in going for the ladder, and he did full justice to Julius's share in the affair.  As to Scarfe's part, he stated just what had happened, without emotion and without effusiveness.  He despised himself for feeling so chilly on the subject, and would have been glad, for Mrs Scarfe's sake, had he felt more warmly his obligations to her son.  But he spoke as he felt.  ""You have had a narrow escape from a watery grave,"" said Mrs Scarfe, anxious to sum up in the hero's favour, ""and my son, I am sure, is thankful to have been the means of saving your life.""  Jeffreys bowed.  ""I am glad he escaped falling in,"" said he.  ""He had no thought of himself, I am sure,"" said Mrs Rimbolt severely, ""and claims no thanks beyond that of his good conscience.""  ""We're going to get him a Royal Humane medal, Jeff,"" added Percy; ""a lot of fellows get it for a good deal less.""  ""I hope he may get one,"" said Jeffreys.  ""You and Julius should have one, too.  I thank you all.""  This was all that could be extracted from this graceless young man, and the unsatisfactory interview was shortly afterwards terminated by Mrs Rimbolt's requesting him to go and tell Walker to bring some more coals for the fire.  His conduct was freely discussed when he was gone.  Mrs Rimbolt looked upon it as a slight put upon herself, and was proportionately wrathful. Mrs Scarfe, more amiable, imagined that it was useless to look for gratitude among persons of Jeffreys' class in life.  Scarfe himself said that, from what he knew of Jeffreys, he would have been surprised had he shown himself possessed of any good feelings.  Percy, considerably puzzled, suggested that he was ""chawed up with his ducking.""  And Raby, still more perplexed, said nothing, and hardly knew what to think.  The next day, as Scarfe was smoking in the park, Jeffreys overtook him. A night's rest had a good deal softened the librarian's spirit.  He was ashamed of himself for not having done his rescuer common justice, and had followed him now to tell him as much.  ""Scarfe,"" said he, ""you will have considered I was ungrateful yesterday.""  ""You were just what I expected you would be.""  ""I am sorry,"" said Jeffreys, now beginning to feel he had better far have said nothing, yet resolved, now he had begun, to go through with it, ""and I wish to thank you now.""  Scarfe laughed.  ""It is I who should be grateful for this condescension,"" said he sneeringly.  ""So disinterested, too.""  ""What do you mean?  How could it be otherwise?""  ""You have a short memory, Cad Jeffreys.  Possibly you have forgotten a little event that happened at Bolsover?""  ""I have not forgotten it.""  ""I dare say you have not thought it worth while to mention it to your employer, Mr Rimbolt.""  ""I have not mentioned it.""  ""Quite so.  That is what I mean when I say it is disinterested in you to come and make friends with me.""  ""That is false,"" said Jeffreys glowing.  ""I neither want nor expect that.""  ""Kind again.  At the same time you are not particularly anxious that people here should hear the tragical history of young Forrester?""  ""For heaven's sake be silent, Scarfe!"" said Jeffreys, to whom the mention of the name, after so many months, came like a blow.  ""I cannot bear it.""  Scarfe laughed.  ""Apparently not.  All I want to say is, that I believe less in your gratitude than in your fear, and you can spare yourself the trouble of keeping up that farce.""  ""I am not afraid of you,"" said Jeffreys, drawing himself up.  ""Of my own conscience I am; and of the memory of poor young Forrester--""  ""Hold your tongue.  I have no wish to hear my friend's name on your lips.""  Jeffreys turned to go.  ""Look here,"" said Scarfe, calling him back, ""I want to say one word.  I am sufficiently interested in Percy Rimbolt to dislike the influence you use upon him.  Your influence upon young boys is not to be trusted, and I warn you to let Percy alone.  You are doing him no good as it is.""  ""Is that all you want to say?"" said Jeffreys.  ""No.  I have my own reason for choosing that you cease to offend Miss Atherton by your attentions.  You are no fit companion for her; and she and I--""  Jeffreys turned on his heel, and did not hear the end of the sentence. He marvelled at himself that he had not struck the fellow contemptuously to the ground; and he absolutely smiled in the midst of his misery at the idea of Scarfe taking upon himself the moral upbringing of Percy and the protector-ship of Raby!  In the midst of these reflections he became aware of the presence of Raby in the walk in front of him.  The rencontre was unexpected on both sides, and promised to be embarrassing for Jeffreys.  Raby, however, came to the rescue.  ""Mr Jeffreys,"" said she, holding out her hand, ""I do hope you are none the worse for yesterday.  I was greatly afraid you would catch cold.""  ""You took the kindest possible way of preventing it,"" said Jeffreys.  ""I never enjoyed a meal as much as the one Walker brought me yesterday, and I thank the kind sender.""  Raby blushed.  ""It was a shame no one else thought of it.  But, Mr Jeffreys, you are thanking me, when it is I who ought to thank you for risking your life for me.""  ""That is a new version of the story,"" said Jeffreys.  ""It was somebody else who risked his life for me, and I know you despise me for appearing so churlish about it.""  ""I was very sorry indeed for you in the drawing-room last night.""  ""I deserved no sympathy.""  ""I fancied you might have gushed a little when you saw how much auntie's heart and Mrs Scarfe's were set on it.  It would not have hurt you.""  ""I cannot gush, Miss Atherton; but I can value your kindness to me, and I do.""  Raby smiled one of her pleasantest smiles.  ""I wish I had half your honesty, Mr Jeffreys.  I am always pretending to be something here which I am not, and I get sick of it.  I wish I were a man.""  ""Why?  Is honesty confined to the male sex?""  ""No; I suppose we can be honest too.  But if I was a man I could go and be of some use somewhere; I'm no good to anybody here.""  Jeffreys coloured up furiously, and looked as if he would run from the spot.  Then, apparently thinking better of it, he looked down at her and said--  ""Excuse me, you are.""  They walked on a little in silence, then Raby said--  ""I am so glad, Mr Jeffreys, you managed Percy so well about that smoking yesterday; and how well he took it!""  ""Of course; he's a gentleman and a fine fellow.""  ""He forgets how much older Mr Scarfe is than he, and he imagines it is a fine thing to do whatever others do.  But I think it is such a pity he should waste so much time as he does now in the billiard-room and over the fire.  Don't you think it is bad for him?""  ""I do.  The day on the ice yesterday made a new man of him.""  ""Do try to coax him out, Mr Jeffreys, you always do him good; and you may be able to pull him up now before he becomes an idler.""  ""I promise you I will do what I can.""  ""He ought to be my brother, and not my cousin,"" said Raby, ""I feel so jealous on his account.""  ""He is fortunate--may I say so?--in his cousin.  Here is Mr Rimbolt.""  Mr Rimbolt had papers in his hand, and looked rather anxious.  Raby, with a daughter's instinct, rushed to him.  ""Uncle, have you news from the war?  Is anything wrong?""  ""Nothing wrong,"" said her uncle reassuringly; ""I brought you this paper to see.  It reports that there has been an encounter with the Afghans near Kandahar, with complete success on the British side and comparatively trifling loss.  Particulars are expected almost immediately.  I telegraphed to town to get the earliest possible details.  Meanwhile, Raby, don't alarm yourself unduly.""  ""I won't, uncle; but where exactly was the battle?""  ""You will see the names mentioned in the telegram.  Jeffreys can show you the exact spot in the atlas; we were looking at it the other evening.""  Jeffreys thankfully accepted the task.  He and Raby spent an hour over the map, talking of the absent soldier, and trying, the one to conceal, the other to allay, the anxiety which the incomplete telegram had aroused.  At the end of the hour Scarfe walked into the library.  His face darkened as he saw the two who sat there.  ""Miss Atherton,"" said he, looking not at her, but at Jeffreys, ""have you forgotten we were to have a ride this morning?""  ""I am so sorry, Mr Scarfe, but I have a headache, and don't feel as if I could ride to-day.  You will excuse me, won't you?""  ""Oh, certainly,"" replied Scarfe; ""don't you think a turn in the park will do you good?  May I have the pleasure of escorting you?""  Raby said, ""Thank you.""  She was very sorry to disappoint any one, and had no valid excuse against a walk.  ""Miss Atherton,"" said Scarfe, when they had gone some distance, chatting on indifferent topics, ""I am anxious just to say a word to you, not in my own interest at all, but your own.  Will you forgive me if I do?""  ""What is it?"" said Raby, mystified.  ""I wish to put you on your guard against Jeffreys, who, I see, presumes on his position here to annoy you.  You may not perhaps know, Miss Atherton, that not two years ago--""  ""Excuse me, Mr Scarfe,"" said Raby quietly, stopping in her walk, ""I hate talking of people behind their backs.  Mr Jeffreys has never annoyed me; he has been kind to me.  Shall we talk of something else?""  ""Certainly,"" said Scarfe, startled at her decided tone.  He had laid his plan for a little revelation, and it disconcerted him to see it knocked on the head like this.  However, just then he was not in the humour for making himself obnoxious to Miss Atherton, of whom, being a susceptible youth, he was decidedly enamoured.  It was a deprivation, certainly, to find his tongue thus unexpectedly tied with regard to Jeffreys, of whose stay at Wildtree he had calculated on making very short work.  The one comfort was, that there was little enough danger of her seeing in the ill-favoured Bolsover cad anything which need make him--Scarfe-- jealous.  Doubtless she took a romantic interest in this librarian; many girls have whims of that sort.  But the idea of her preferring him to the smart Oxford hero was preposterous.  Jeffreys would still believe in the sword of Damocles which hung above him, and the time might come when Raby would cease to stand between him and his Nemesis.    CHAPTER EIGHTEEN.  WILD PIKE.  Before breakfast on the following morning, Scarfe, in fulfilment of a long-standing engagement with a college friend to spend a day with him, rode off to catch the train at Overstone, and consequently was not present when the post arrived, and with it a telegram from London for Mr Rimbolt.  Raby, who had been on the watch, could scarcely allow her uncle time to examine its contents before claiming it; and had it contained bad news, the chance of breaking them would have been out of the question.  But it did not contain bad news.  On the contrary, as Raby devoured the few official lines she became radiant with pride and happiness.  The telegram was a copy of a dispatch received the evening before at the War Office:--  ""News is to hand of a sharp brush with the Afghans on the 4th inst. at ---, two days' march from Kandahar.  About mid-day the--Hussars, commanded by Major Atherton, in advance of the main body, encountered and dislodged from a defile on the right bank of the river a considerable body of the enemy, who fled to the plain.  It becoming evident the enemy was at hand in force, a battery of field guns was pushed forward, under the escort of a troop of Hussars; and the main body followed in two columns.  The cavalry meanwhile, having cleared the defile and chased the enemy into the plain beyond, became involved in a desperate scrimmage, the Afghans having descended in full force into the plain with the evident intention of cutting them off from the main body. Major Atherton, completely hemmed in, made a desperate stand, in which upwards of twenty of his men perished, the gallant officer himself having his horse shot under him.  The guns meanwhile, escorted by Captain Forrester, of the--Hussars, gained the head of the defile, where they were immediately surrounded by the enemy.  A brilliant resistance here ensued, in which more than half of the escort were killed in their effort to save the guns.  Towards the end, Captain Forrester nearly single-handed kept the enemy at bay until the cavalry, breaking through, and joining forces with the two columns of the main body as they emerged on the plain, effectually turned the position and saved the guns.  The loss of the enemy was very considerable, and it is considered that this action clears the way to Kandahar, which the troops are expected to occupy in two days without further resistance.  Our loss, considering the perilous position of the cavalry and gunners, was comparatively slight.  Captain Forrester at the last moment fell after a resistance as heroic as any witnessed in the course of the campaign.  Major Atherton received a scratch on the wrist; which, however, is not likely to disable him even temporarily.  The main body never came into action at all, and suffered no casualties.  A full list of the killed and wounded is appended.""  Jeffreys, who found himself almost as eager for news as if he had been personally interested, found it difficult to wait patiently until Mr Rimbolt came after breakfast to the library.  ""Is there news from the war?"" he asked.  ""Yes--good news, Miss Atherton has the telegram.  Her father took part in a very brilliant engagement a day or two ago, which appears to have cleared the way to Kandahar.  He was scratched, but not seriously.""  Jeffreys received this good news with great satisfaction.  It was a relief to him to hear it in the first instance not from Raby's lips, for he never knew what to do or say on such occasions.  ""Miss Atherton must be very proud,"" said he, returning to his work.  He was not, however, destined to remain long undisturbed.  Raby, radiant and excited, entered the library a few minutes later.  ""Mr Jeffreys,"" said she, ""such splendid news.  Has uncle told you?  I thought you would like to read the telegram; here it is.""  Jeffreys looked his congratulations as he took the paper.  ""Read it aloud, Mr Jeffreys,"" said the happy girl, ""I should like to hear how it sounds.""  Jeffreys smiled and began to read; Raby, who knew it all by heart, seeming to check off every word.  Suddenly, however, in the middle of the narrative the reader started and changed colour, and became unaccountably breathless.  ""The guns meanwhile, escorted by--"" he had got so far.  ""`Captain Forrester of the--Hussars.'  Go on,"" said Raby.  It needed all his self-command to finish the reading, and when he came to the end and handed back the paper, Raby perceived that his hand shook and his face was deadly pale.  ""Why, what is the matter, Mr Jeffreys?"" said she, suddenly alarmed herself; ""it is good news, isn't it? and he has only got a scratch!""  ""Yes, it is good news; and I congratulate you.""  ""But you look--perhaps you know some one who has been killed.  You never told me you had any friend out there.""  ""I have not.  I think I must be not quite well; will you excuse me?""  And he went out into the open air, leaving Raby very much perplexed and concerned.  She was relieved, however, to see him half an hour later starting off with Percy for what, to judge by their mountain boots and the luncheon box strapped across Jeffreys' shoulders, promised to be a long walk.  Jeffreys' first sensations on finding himself alone had been those of stupefaction.  Although all that he knew of Forrester's father was that he had been in India, it never occurred to him now for a moment that the gallant officer mentioned in the telegram could be any other than the father whom he had so cruelly and irreparably wronged.  And now once more he seemed suddenly face to face with his crime.  He saw before him that fatal scene in the Bolsover meadow; he heard his comrades' howl of execration and saw the boy's white face on the grass turned up to meet his.  It seemed but yesterday.  Nay, it seemed all to be there that moment; he could feel the keen breeze on his cheek; his eye rested on the boy's cap where he had flung it; he was conscious of Mr Freshfield's look of horror--he could even see twenty yards away the football lying idle between the goals.  Strange, that the doubtful mention of an officer's name should call it all up thus!  But so it was.  He even seemed half guilty of that gallant death in Afghanistan.  Had he not wronged him worse than death? and now if anywhere the friendless boy, whose whole hope was in his father, should read those lines and find himself orphaned as well as crippled!  Jeffreys in his misery groaned aloud.  ""Hullo,"" said Percy, in the path before him, ""you in the blues too! What a jolly sell!  Here am I as miserable as an owl, and everybody I meet's miserable too.  Scarfe's gone to Sharpfield, and won't be back till late.  Raby's so taken up with her precious telegram that she won't look at me.  Ma and Mrs Scarfe, have bagged the pony trap and Appleby, and now you're looking as if you'd just been hung.""  ""What are you in the blues about?"" said Jeffreys, brightening up a bit.  ""Oh, everything.  It's so slow here, nothing to do.  Can't play games all day, and you won't let me smoke, and the library hasn't a single story worth reading, and it's beastly cold; and upon my word,"" said the boy, who was genuinely miserable, ""I'd as soon go and sit on the top of Wild Pike as fool about here.""  ""The best thing you could do--I'll go and sit with you,"" said Jeffreys.  ""What!"" said the boy, ""do you mean it?  Will you come?""  ""Of course I will; I have nothing special to do to-day, and I've never been up a mountain in winter before.""  ""We shall get a splendid view.  Sure it won't grind you?"" said the boy, who, under Scarfe's influence, had come to look upon every exertion as a thing to be shirked.  ""My dear fellow, I shall enjoy it, especially with you,"" said Jeffreys.  ""Hurrah--bring Julius too--and I'll get some grub to take.  It's only ten now, and it's not dark till after four, so we have a good six hours.""  A few minutes later they started, Percy leaving word for his mother that they were going for a long tramp, and would be back for dinner.  It was a perfect winter's day.  The air was keen and frosty and promised magnificent views.  The wind was not strong enough to be benumbing, and the sun overhead was cheering and now and then even warm.  ""Hadn't we better take overcoats, in case it comes on cold at the top?"" said Jeffreys as they were starting.  ""Oh no--they're a frightful grind to carry, and we are sure to be baked before we get up.""  ""I think I will take mine,"" said Jeffreys, ""and it will be no bother to carry yours.""  Percy protested, but, luckily for them, Jeffreys carried his point.  Wild Pike was one of those mountains, not uncommon in that district, which are approached from the back by a long gradual slope, but on the front present a scooped-out precipitous face, as if broken in half on that side.  It was this steeper side which faced Wildtree, and Percy would have scorned to approach the monster from any other quarter.  From where they stood the narrow path zigzagged for about one thousand feet onto one of the upper shoulders of the mountain.  Following this, the track brought them to what seemed like the basin of some old volcano hollowed out under the summit.  It was necessary to cross this depression, and by a narrow ledge at the foot of the great cliff gain the other side, where another zigzag ascent brought them onto the rocky slope leading over a quarter of a mile of huge boulders to the summit.  The passage across the face of the mountain was the most difficult part of the ascent.  It lay along a narrow ledge hanging, so it seemed, half- way down the perpendicular cliff which rose out of the hollow, crater- like basin sheer up to the summit.  It was tolerably level, but the narrowness of the track and the precipitous height above and below called for a cool head and a steady foot.  In frosty weather like the present it needed special caution, and every step had to be carefully judged on the treacherous path.  However, they passed it safely.  Julius alone seemed to find it difficult.  The dog was strangely awkward to-day.  He slid about where the others walked steadily, and whimpered at obstacles which they seemed scarcely to heed.  ""Now for the grub,"" cried Percy, as they landed safely on the other side.  ""I say, Jeff, I call that something like a mountain, don't you? I'm quite sorry we're over the worst of it, aren't you?""  ""We've got the view to see yet,"" responded Jeffreys.  ""We shall be up in half an hour.""  ""And it will take us as long to come down as to go up to-day,"" said Jeffreys, ""so we ought not to lose much time.""  Off they started again after a hurried but highly appreciated meal, in which the dog took only a very moderate share.  The remaining portion of the ascent was simple enough.  The zigzag onto the top shoulder was if anything less steep than the lower one, and the path, being rougher underfoot, was less treacherous.  The scramble over the loose rocks at the top onto the cairn was not altogether plain sailing.  In summer it was easy enough, but now, with the surface of the great boulders as slippery as glass, it was hardly to be traversed except on the hands and knees.  Poor Julius floundered about pitifully, unable to keep his feet, and disappearing bodily now and then among the interstices of the rocky way. Even Percy and Jeffreys stumbled once or twice awkwardly, and reached the summit with bruised limbs.  But _finis coronat opus_, especially on a mountain.  As they sprang up the cairn a view unequalled in grandeur broke upon them.  The frosty air was without haze in any quarter.  The Scotch hills beyond the border and the broad heaving sea lay apparently equally within reach, and on the farthest western horizon even the fairy-like outline of the distant Irish hills, never visible except in the clearest winter weather, shone out distinctly.  ""Isn't it scrumptious?"" exclaimed Percy, as he flung himself breathless onto the cairn.  ""If we had waited a year we couldn't have picked out such a day.  Why, that must be Snowdon we see over there, and the high ground out at sea, Holyhead?""  Thus they went on, delightedly recognising the landmarks north, south, east, and west, and forgetting both the hour and the rising breeze.  ""Why, it's two o'clock!"" cried Percy presently, looking at his watch, and shivering at the same time.  ""Put on your coat,"" said Jeffreys; ""the wind's getting up a bit, and we shall have it in our faces going down.""  As they started to descend they became aware of a sudden change in the hitherto cloudless day.  The western horizon, which had just now been unfolding its distant beauties, seemed lost in a fine haze, which spread north and south, blotting out one after another the glories of landscape on which they had scarcely ceased to feast their eyes.  ""There's a mist out there,"" said Percy, as they scrambled down the boulders; ""I hope to goodness it will keep away from us.""  ""The wind is a little north-west; it may drive it south of us, but it is spreading at a great rate.""  ""Never mind; it will be rather a joke if it comes.  I could find the way down with my eyes shut, and I've often wanted to be in a regular fog up here,"" said Percy.  ""I don't know what you feel,"" responded Jeffreys; ""but I'm rather glad we brought our coats.  Isn't it cold?""  The wind which met them seemed charged with cold, and after a while began to scatter a feathery sleet in their faces.  Percy whistled.  ""We didn't bargain for that, I say,"" said he.  ""I hope it shuts up before we cross over the ledge down there.""  Julius howled dismally.  He, too, guessed what this blinding shower-bath foreboded, and stumbled along, miserable and shivering.  The higher zigzag, which had seemed easy enough two hours ago, tried them sorely now.  The sleet half blinded them, and the fresh moisture, freezing as it fell, caused them to slip and slide at every step.  Still they got down it somehow, and turned to face the narrow track along the cliff.  Percy, much as he repined at the change in the elements, felt no doubt as to the possibility of getting over.  ""We may have to crawl a bit of the way if this sort of thing goes on,"" said he, ""but it's straight enough sailing.""  ""Would it be better,"" suggested Jeffreys, ""to go to the top again and get down by the Sharpenholme track?""  ""We shouldn't get home till midnight if we did; besides, I don't know the way.  We're all right this way if we look sharp.""  The wind had now increased to a tempest, and beat against the side of the great cliff with a sound like the sea breaking on an iron-bound shore.  They could scarcely hear one another speak; and poor Julius's whines were drowned in the great clamour.  ""Do you mind my going first?"" said Percy; ""I know the path better than you.""  Jeffreys nodded, and they started.  The first step they took on that ledge threatened for a moment to be their last.  The wind, gathering fury every moment, beat Percy to his knees, and nearly sent Jeffreys staggering over the ledge.  ""We shall have to crawl,"" said Percy.  ""It's no use waiting.  The wind and sleet are going to make a night of it, and we shall gain nothing by waiting.""  The start was begun again--this time cautiously and on all-fours.  Even so the wind seemed once or twice as if it would sweep them from the ledge.  Yard by yard they crawled on.  The driving mist fell like a pall over the mountain, and in a few minutes they could not even see a yard in front of them.  Had the wind blown crosswise, or in any other way than that in which it came, they would have been swept off before twenty yards were accomplished.  As it was, they were almost pinned to the cliff by the fury of the blast.  They must have proceeded a quarter of the way across, and had reached a spot where the ledge rose slightly.  Even up this slight incline, with the mist freezing under them, it was impossible to crawl; and Percy, drawing himself cautiously to his feet, attempted to stand.  As he did so, the wind, gathering itself into a furious blast, caught him and hurled him against the rocky wall.  He recoiled with a sharp cry of pain, and next moment would have fallen into the abyss beneath, had not Jeffreys' strong arm caught him and held him.  His legs were actually off the ledge, and for a moment it seemed as if both he and his protector were doomed.  But with a tremendous effort the prostrate Jeffreys swung him back onto the track.  ""Are you hurt?"" he called.  ""My arm,"" said Percy.  ""I'm afraid I can't get on.  I'll try.""  But the attempt only called up a fresh exclamation of pain.  ""We must wait,"" said Jeffreys.  ""Try to sit up, old fellow.  I'll help you.""  It was evident that the boy's arm, if not broken, was so severely damaged as to render it powerless.  ""I could stay here, I think,"" said he, ""if you went on, Jeff.""  ""Nonsense!"" said Jeffreys; ""we'll send Julius to fetch help.  Here, Julius, good dog,"" said he, patting the dog's head and pointing down to the valley, ""go and fetch them here.  Fetch Appleby, and Walker, and Mr Rimbolt.  Go along, good fellow.""  The dog, who had been crawling behind them, looked wistfully at his master and licked the hand that caressed him.  Then, stepping carefully across them as they sat with their backs to the rock and their feet beyond the edge of the path, he departed.  He was out of sight almost a yard away, but they heard him whine once as the wind dashed him against the cliff.  ""Julius, good dog, fetch them!"" shouted Jeffreys into the mist.  A faint answering bark came back.  Next moment, through the storm, came a wild howl, and they heard him no more.  Jeffreys guessed only too well what that howl meant; but he never stirred, as with his arm round Percy, and his cloak screening him from the wind, he looked hopelessly out into the night and waited.    CHAPTER NINETEEN.  SCARFE PROMISES TO REMEMBER.  ""Jeff,"" said Percy, after a minute or two, ""it's nonsense your staying here to get frozen; do go on.""  ""No, old fellow; I prefer your company to my own.""  ""But, Jeff, we may not last out till the morning.""  ""We won't give it up yet, though.""  Jeffreys had great faith in the caloric of hope, especially for a boy of Percy's temperament.  For himself he saw enough to guess that their position was a desperate one. The ledge on which they sat was narrow and slanting, and the wind, shifting gradually to the west, began to get round them menacingly, and cause them now and then to grip at the stones while some specially furious gust blew past.  Add to that, Percy's arm was probably broken, and, despite a makeshift bandage and sling, adjusted at imminent peril of being swept away in the operation, increasingly painful.  The mist wrapped them like a winding-sheet, and froze as it fell.  ""How long will Julius take getting down?"" asked the boy.  ""Not long,"" said Jeffreys, with a shudder, not wholly caused by the cold.  ""An hour?  He could bring them up in three hours, couldn't he?""  ""Less, perhaps.  We can hold out for three hours.""  ""Jeff, old fellow, do go; what _is_ the use of you staying?""  ""Harder work for the wind to lift two of us than one.  It can't last long, I'm certain; it's chopping already.""  They relapsed into silence, and listened to the storm as it dashed on the cliffs above them.  A quarter of an hour passed.  Then Jeffreys felt the boy's head drop on his shoulder.  ""Percy, old man, no sleeping,"" said he, raising his head.  ""I'm not sleeping; only wondering where Julius is.""  But his voice was drowsy, and the words drawled out slowly and dreamily.  ""Perhaps he's down the lower zigzag now,"" said Jeffreys, giving his companion a shake, under pretext of readjusting the wraps.  ""I guess he'll go to Raby first,"" said Percy.  ""Won't she be scared?""  ""She will probably go to your father, and he'll get Appleby and Kennedy and some of the men, and they'll--Percy! hold up your head!""  ""Scarfe would like to get engaged to Raby, but she would sooner--""  ""Percy, old man, you're talking rubbish.  Unless you sit up and keep awake we shall both come to grief.""  ""I'll try,"" said the boy, ""but I don't know how.""  ""Tell me something about your year at Rugby.  I want to hear about it so much.  What form were you in?""  Then followed a desperate half-hour of cross-examination, Jeffreys coming down with a question at the slightest symptom of drowsiness, and Percy, with all the cunning of a ""somno-maniac,"" taking time to think before each answer, and even shirking a syllable here or there in order to snatch a wink.  The daylight slowly faded out of the mist, but still the wind howled and shook them on their narrow perch at every gust.  Jeffreys, with dismay, found his limbs growing cramped and stiff, boding ill, unless relief soon came, for the possibility of moving at all.  Surely, though, the wind was abating.  The dash overhead sounded a trifle less deafening; and the driving sleet, which an hour ago had struck on their faces, now froze their ears.  Yes, the wind was shifting and falling.  In the half-minute which it took Jeffreys to make this discovery Percy had once more fallen asleep, and it required a shake more prolonged than ever to arouse him.  ""What!"" said he, as he slowly raised his head, ""are they here?  Is father there?""  ""No, old boy, but the wind is going down, and we may be able to move soon.  Where did you field in that cricket match you were telling me of?""  ""Short leg, and I made two catches.""  ""Bravo!  Were they hard ones?  Tell me.""  So for another half-hour this struggle with sleep went on.  Jeffreys had more to do than keep his companion awake.  He accompanied every question with a change of position of his knees and arms, that he might be able when the time came to use his limbs.  It was little enough scope he had for any movement on that narrow ledge, but he lost no chance, and his self-imposed fidgets helped not only himself but Percy.  At last the roar on the cliffs changed into a surly soughing, and the gusts edged slowly but surely round behind the great buttress of the mountain.  ""Percy,"" said Jeffreys, ""we must try a move.  Can you hold yourself steady while I try to get up?""  Percy was wide awake in an instant.  ""I can hold on, but my other arm is no good for scrambling.""  ""I'll see to that, only hold on while I get up.""  It was a long and painful operation; every joint and muscle seemed to be congealed.  At length, however, by dint of a terrible effort, he managed to draw up his feet and even to stand on the path.  He kicked up the earth so as to make a firm foothold, and then addressed himself to the still more difficult task of raising the stiff and crippled Percy.  How he did it, and how he half dragged, half carried him back along the ledge to the firmer ground of the upper zigzag path, he never knew.  He always counted it as one of the miracles of his life, the work of that stronger than human arm which had already helped him along his path, and which in this act showed that it still was with him.  To stand even on that steep mountain path was, after the peril of that fearful ledge, like standing on a broad paved road.  ""Where next?"" said Percy.  ""Over the top and down by the Sharpenholme track.  Do you see the moon is coming out through the mist?""  ""All serene!""  The heroism of that night's adventure was not all absorbed by the elder traveller.  The boy who with indomitable hopefulness toiled up that steep ascent with a broken arm bandaged to his side, making nothing of his pain, was a type of English boy happily still to be met with, giving promise of men of the right stuff yet to come to maintain the good name of their country.  They were not much in the humour for admiring the wonderful beauty of the scene as the mist gradually cleared and above them rose the full white moon flooding the mountain and the hills beyond with its pure light.  They welcomed the light, for it showed them the way; but they would have sold the view twenty times over for a pot of hot coffee.  At the top they met the tail end of the gale spending its little remaining force on the mountain's back.  It seemed like a balmy zephyr compared with the tempest of a few hours ago.  The descent down the broad grass track with its slight covering of snow towards Sharpenholme had little difficulty; but the jolting tried Percy's arm as the steep climb with all its exertion had not done.  Jeffreys noticed the boy's steps become more unsteady, and felt him lean with increasing heaviness on his arm.  ""Percy, old boy, you are done up.""  ""No--I--Suppose we rest a minute or two; I shall be all right.""  But while he spoke he staggered faintly and would have fallen but for Jeffreys' arm in his.  ""I think if you went on,"" said he, ""I could rest a bit and follow slowly.""  Jeffreys' answer was curt and decisive.  He took the boy up in his arms as if he had been a baby, and, despite all protestations, carried him.  On level ground and under ordinary circumstances it would have been a simple matter.  For Jeffreys was brawny and powerful; and the light weight of the slender, wiry boy was nothing to him.  But on that slippery mountain-side, after the fatigue and peril of the afternoon, it was as much as he could do to stagger forward under the burden.  Yet--was it quite unnatural?--a strange sort of happiness seemed to take possession of him as he felt this helpless boy's form in his arms, the head drooped on his shoulder, and the poor bruised arm tenderly supported in his hand.  There seemed hope in the burden; and in that brotherly service a promise of expiation for another still more sacred service which had been denied him!  He tramped down that long gradual slope in a contented dream, halting often to rest, but never losing heart.  Percy, too exhausted to remonstrate, yielded himself gratefully, and lay only half conscious in his protector's arms, often fancying himself at home in bed or lolling idly in the summer fields.  It may have been midnight, or later still, when Jeffreys, looking beyond the shadows projected by the moon in front of him, perceived a gleam of light far down in the valley.  ""Probably,"" thought he, ""some honest shepherd, after his day's work, is happily going to rest.  Think of a bed, and a pillow, and a blanket!""  But no, the light--the lights, there were two--were moving--moving rapidly and evenly.  Jeffreys stood still to listen.  The wind had long since dropped into rest, and the clear night air would have carried a sound twice the distance.  Yes, it was a cart or a carriage, and he could even detect the clatter of the horses on the hard road.  Possibly some benighted wagoner, or a mail cart.  He raised a shout which scared the sleeping rabbits in their holes and made the hill across the valley wake with echoes.  The lights still moved on.  He set Percy down tenderly on the grass with his coat beneath him.  Then, running with all his speed, he halved the distance which separated him and the road, and shouted again.  This time the clatter of the hoofs stopped abruptly and the lights stood still.  Once more he shouted, till the night rang with echoes.  Then, joyful sound! there rose from the valley an answering call, and he knew all was safe.  In a few minutes he was back again where Percy, once more awake, was sitting up, bewildered, and listening to the echoes which his repeated shouts still kept waking.  ""It's all right, old fellow; there's a carriage.""  ""They've come to look for us.  I can walk, Jeff, really.""  ""Are you sure?""  ""Yes, and they'd be so scared if they saw me being carried.""  So they started forward, the answering shouts coming nearer and nearer at every step.  ""That's Appleby,"" said Percy, as a particularly loud whoop fell on their ears.  It was, and with him Mr Rimbolt and Scarfe.  When darkness came, and no signs of the pedestrians, the usual uneasiness had prevailed at Wildtree, increased considerably by Walker's and Raby's report as to the mountaineering garb in which the missing ones had started.  The terrible tempest which had attacked the face of Wild Pike had swept over Wildtree too, and added a hundredfold to the alarm which, as hour passed hour, their absence caused.  Scarfe, arriving at home about ten o'clock, found the whole family in a state of panic.  Mr Rimbolt had been out on the lower slopes of the mountain, and reported that a storm raged there before which nothing could stand. The only hope was that they had been descending the back of the mountain, and taken refuge somewhere in the valley for the night.  The carriage was ordered out, and Mr Rimbolt and Scarfe started on what seemed a forlorn hope.  For an hour or two they passed and repassed the valley road, inquiring at every cottage and farm without result.  At last, just as they were resolving to give it up for the night, Appleby pulled up the horses suddenly, and said he had heard a shout. Instantly they jumped out and shouted back; and now, following the direction of the voice, far up the great slope, they _met_ Jeffreys, with the boy leaning on his arm safe, but almost exhausted.  Neither of them retained a vivid recollection of that drive home. Jeffreys was vaguely conscious of them calling on the way for the doctor, and taking him along in the carriage.  He also heard Scarfe say something to Mr Rimbolt in tones of commiseration, in which something was added about the inconsiderateness and untrustworthiness of Jeffreys. But for the rest he reclined back in his seat, scarcely conscious of anything but the rest and warmth.  At Wildtree, the now familiar scene of the whole household gathered panic-struck an the threshold drove him precipitately to his room.  He knew what to expect if he stayed there.  Jeffreys dropped asleep with the dog's howl ringing weirdly in his ears. In his dreams it seemed to change into that still more terrible howl which had stunned him long ago on the Bolsover meadow.  It followed him as he carried young Forrester in his arms across that fatal ledge.  It was pitch dark; and on the ledge Scarfe stood to drive him back.  Then suddenly a new bright path seemed to open at his side, into which he stepped with his precious burden.  And as he did so he saw, far off, Raby standing at the end of the way.  It was ten o'clock when he awoke; but the house was still asleep.  Only a few servants were stirring; and even Walker had taken advantage of the occasion to ""sleep in.""  Jeffreys was tough and hardy; and the night's rest had done more for him than twenty doctors.  He got up, shook himself, and behold his limbs were strong under him, and his head was clear and cool.  He dressed himself quietly and descended to the kitchen, where he begged an early breakfast of the servants.  Then he sallied forth with his stick towards Wild Pike.  The grand pile on this bright winter's morning looked almost hypocritically serene and benignant.  The sunlight bathed the stern cliff which yesterday had buffeted back the wind with a roar as fierce as itself; and in the quiet spring-like air the peaceful bleating of sheep was the only sound to be heard on the steep mountain-side.  But Jeffreys did not turn his steps upward.  On the contrary, he kept to the lowest track in the valley, and took the path which led him nearest to the base of that terrible wall of rock.  A hard scramble over the fallen stones brought him to a spot where, looking up, the top of the wall frowned down on him from a sheer height of five hundred feet, while half-way down, like a narrow scratch along the face of the cliff, he could just detect the ledge on which last night they had sat out the storm.  There, among the stones, shattered and cold, lay all that remained of the brave Julius.  His fate must have overtaken him before he had gone twenty yards on his desperate errand, and almost before that final howl reached his master's ears all must have been over.  Jeffreys, as he tenderly lifted his lost friend in his arms, thought bitterly and reproachfully of the dog's strange conduct yesterday--his evident depression and forebodings of evil--the result, no doubt, of illness, but making that last act of self-devotion all the more heroic.  He made a grave there at the base of that grand cliff, and piled up a little cairn to mark the last resting-place of his friend.  Then, truly a mourner, he returned slowly to Wildtree.  At the door he encountered Mrs Rimbolt, who glared at him and swept past.  ""How is Percy this morning?"" he inquired.  ""No thanks to you, Mr Jeffreys,"" said the lady, with a double venom in her tones, ""he is alive.""  ""His arm, is it--?""  ""Go to your work, sir,"" said the lady; ""I have no wish to speak to you.""  Jeffreys bowed and retreated.  He had expected such a reception, and just now it neither dismayed nor concerned him.  On the staircase he met Raby.  She looked pale and anxious, but brightened up as she saw him.  ""Mr Jeffreys,"" said she, ""are you really up, and none the worse?""  ""I am well, thank you,"" said he, ""but very anxious to hear about Percy.""  ""He has had a bad night with his arm, but the doctor says he is going on all right.  What a terrible adventure you had.  Percy told me a little of it.  Oh, Mr Jeffreys, it is all my fault!""  Jeffreys could not help smiling.  ""By what stretch of ingenuity do you make that out?""  ""It was I suggested your coaxing Percy out, you know; I might have been the death of you both.""  ""You did not send the wind, did you, or the mist?  If you did, of course you are quite entitled to all the credit.""  ""Don't laugh about it, please.  Percy was telling me how if it had not been for you--""  ""He would never have been in any danger.  Perhaps he is right.  By the way.  Miss Atherton, is there any chance of seeing him?""  ""He has asked for you already; but auntie, I believe, would have a fit if you went near him.  She seems to consider you are his evil genius; instead of being just the opposite.  Tell me how Julius is--he went with you, did he not?""  ""I have been out this morning to bury Julius at the place where he fell.""  Raby, already unduly excited by the events of the past few days, broke into tears, and at the same moment Scarfe, descending the stairs, stood before them.  He looked first at Jeffreys, next at the girl.  Then, taking her arm, he said--  ""What is the matter?  May I take you downstairs?""  ""Oh no,"" she cried, pushing away his hand, and dashing the tears from her eyes.  ""Mr Jeffreys, I am so sorry, do forgive me!"" and she ran upstairs to her own room.  Jeffreys and Scarfe stood facing one another.  ""What is the meaning of this?"" said the latter wrathfully.  ""It would not interest you.  I was telling Miss Atherton about my dog.""  ""Hang your dog!  Did not I tell you that I did not choose for you to obtrude yourself on Raby?""  ""You did, and I should be sorry to obtrude myself on any one, whether you choose it or not.""  ""You appear to forget, Cad Jeffreys--""  ""I forget nothing--not even that I am keeping you from your breakfast.""  And he quitted the scene.  Later in the morning, as he was working in the library, Mr Rimbolt entered and greeted him cordially.  ""Jeffreys, my dear fellow, you are constantly adding new claims on my gratitude.  What can I say to you now to thank you for your heroism yesterday, about which Percy has just told us?""  ""Pray say nothing, and discount Percy's story heavily, for he was the hero.  With his broken arm and in all the danger he never lost heart for a moment.""  ""Yes, he is a brave boy, too.  But I came now to tell you he is asking for you.  Will you come and see him?""  Jeffreys followed the father gratefully to the sick-chamber.  At the door he encountered Mrs Rimbolt, who, having evidently been present at the boy's narrative, was pleased to regard him almost graciously, and, delightfully ignoring the previous encounter, to wish him good morning. Percy looked hot and feverish, but brightened up at once as he caught sight of his protector.  ""Hullo, old Jeff,"" said he, ""isn't this all nonsense?  They say I'm in for a mild congestion, and shall have to stick in bed for a fortnight. Just sit down; do you mind, and stay with me.  You've pulled me through so far; you may as well finish the job.""  Thus informally, and without consulting anybody, Jeffreys was constituted nurse-in-chief in the sick-chamber.  The boy would tolerate no discussion or protest on the part of the authorities.  He must have old Jeff.  Bother a hospital nurse, bother the doctor, bother Scarfe, bother everybody.  He wanted Jeff; and if Jeff couldn't come he didn't mean to take his medicine or do anything he ought to do.  Walker had better put up a chair-bed in the dressing-room for Jeff, and Jeff and he (Percy) could have their grub together.  Of course all the others could come and see him, especially Raby--but he meant to have Jeff there for good, and that was flat.  Thus this selfish young invalid arranged for his own pleasure, and upset all the sober arrangements of his friends.  Jeffreys delightedly accepted his new duty, and faced the jealousy of Mrs Rimbolt and Scarfe unflinchingly.  It was certainly an unfortunate position for the fond mother; and little wonder if in her mind Jeffreys' brave service should be blotted out in the offence of being preferred before herself in the sick-chamber.  She readily lent an ear to the insinuations which Scarfe, also bitterly hurt, freely let out, and persuaded herself miserably that her boy was in the hands of an adventurer who had cajoled not only the boy but the father, and in short personated the proverbial viper at the fireside.  So the fortnight passed.  Percy turned the corner; and the time for the departure of Mrs Scarfe and her son drew near.  Percy on the evening before they went had been less bright than usual, and had alarmed Jeffreys by a slight return of feverishness.  He had just dropped off to sleep, and seemed about to settle quietly for the night, when the door opened and Scarfe came in.  Jeffreys was there in an instant with his hand raised in warning.  ""Hush, please,"" said he, ""he has just gone over.""  ""Whom are you telling to hush? you canting brute!"" said Scarfe, raising his voice in a passion unusual for him.  ""Let me come in, do you hear?""  And he moved forward, as if to force his way into the room.  Jeffreys caught him by the two elbows and lifted him bodily out into the landing, and then stood with his back to the door.  Scarfe, livid with rage, made no attempt to get back into the room. Turning on his adversary, he said between his teeth--  ""I shall remember this,"" and departed.    CHAPTER TWENTY.  A POLITE LETTER-WRITER.  Scarfe descended to the drawing-room, where he found Mrs Rimbolt alone.  ""I am so sorry you are going,"" said she.  ""Your visit has been greatly spoiled, I fear.  You must come to us at Easter, when we shall be in London, you know.""  ""Thank you; I shall be glad to come.  I hope to find Percy well again. I went to wish him good-bye just now, but was pretty abruptly denied admission, so I must ask you to say good-bye for me.""  ""Dear me, it is very annoying.  I cannot understand the craze the boy has taken for this companion of his.  I am so sorry you should have been annoyed.""  ""I assure you I am far more annoyed on Percy's account than my own.  I happen to know something of Jeffreys before he came to Wildtree.  To tell you the truth, Mrs Rimbolt, I don't think he is a safe companion for Percy at all.""  ""I have long felt the same; but what is to be done, Mr Scarfe?  Mr Rimbolt has almost the same craze as Percy for this librarian of his, and I have really no voice in the matter.  He contrives to leave nothing definite to lay hold of; I should be thankful if he did.  But it is most uncomfortable to feel that one's own son is perhaps being ruined under this roof.""  ""It must be.  It is no business of mine, of course, except that I am fond of Percy, and should be sorry to see harm come to him; and knowing what I do--""  At that moment Mr Rimbolt, with Mrs Scarfe, entered the room.  ""What secrets are you two talking?"" said the latter.  ""Your son was just telling me how fond he is of Percy; and I am sure it will be a great loss to Percy when he is gone.  He has promised me to come to see us in town at Easter.""  ""It is a satisfaction that you can leave with the assurance that Percy is virtually well again,"" said Mr Rimbolt.  ""Really, I do not know how we should have got on without Mr Jeffreys to nurse him.  I never knew such devotion.  He has never wanted for a thing all the time; and Jeffreys' influence is of the highest and manliest sort.  Percy will be able to reckon this illness among the blessings of his life.""  Mr Rimbolt spoke feelingly and warmly.  Scarfe and Mrs Rimbolt exchanged glances; and the conversation shortly afterwards turned to the journey before the travellers.  Scarfe had come down to the drawing-room resolved, cost what it would, to settle scores with Jeffreys there and then by denouncing him to the family on whose favour he was dependent; and had Mr Rimbolt's entrance been delayed a few minutes, Mrs Rimbolt would have known all about young Forrester.  Once again, however, he was stopped in time, and a few moments' reflection convinced him it was as well.  Raby, he knew, whatever she might think of Jeffreys, would never forgive the informant who should be the means of turning him out of Wildtree, still less would Percy.  Nor was Mr Rimbolt likely to esteem his guest more highly in the capacity of tale-bearer; and he decidedly wished to ""keep in"" with all three.  And there was another reason still.  Scarfe was at the bottom of his heart not quite a villain, and much as he detested Jeffreys, and longed to be revenged--for what injury do certain minds feel half so much as that which one man commits in being better than another?--he had an uncomfortable suspicion in his mind that after all Jeffreys was not quite the miscreant he tried to imagine him.  That he was guilty in the matter of young Forrester there was no doubt; but much as he should have liked to believe it, he could not be quite sure that the accident at Bolsover was the result of a deliberate murderous design, or indeed of anything more than the accidental catastrophe of a blundering fit of temper--criminal, if you like, and cowardly, but not fiendish.  And his conscience made coward enough of him just now to cause him to hesitate before plunging into ruin one who, hateful as he was to him, was after all a poor wretch, miserable enough for any one.  Not having done what he intended to do, Scarfe felt decidedly virtuous, and considered himself entitled to any amount of credit for his forbearance!  It seemed a pity Raby should not know of this noble effort of self-denial.  ""Miss Atherton,"" said he, just as they were about to separate for the night, ""I'm afraid you will have forgotten all about me when you see me next.""  ""You are very uncomplimentary, Mr Scarfe.""  ""I do not mean to be; and I'm sure I shall not forget you.""  ""Thank you.  This has been a very eventful visit.""  ""It has; but I shall never regret that day on the ice, although I fear I made one enemy by what I did.""  ""You don't understand Mr Jeffreys; he is very shy and proud.""  ""I understand him quite well, and wish for Percy's sake every one here did too.  But I am not going to disobey you, and talk of people behind their backs, Miss Atherton.  I am sure you will approve of that.""  ""I do; I never like it unless it is something nice of them.""  ""Then I certainly had better not talk to you about Mr Jeffreys,"" said Scarfe with a sneer, which did him more damage in Raby's eyes than a torrent of abuse from his lips.  ""Do you know you have never yet shown me the telegram you had about your father's last battle?  It came the morning I was away, you know.""  ""Yes.  I fancied perhaps you did not care to see it, as you never asked me,"" said Raby, producing the precious paper from her dress, where she kept it like a sort of talisman.  ""How could you think that?"" said Scarfe reproachfully, who had quite forgotten to ask to see it.  He took the paper and glanced down it.  ""Hullo!"" said he, starting as Jeffreys had done.  ""Captain Forrester!  I wonder if that's poor young Forrester's father?""  ""Who is poor young Forrester?"" inquired Raby.  Scarfe read the paper to the end, and then looked up in well-simulated confusion.  ""Poor young Forrester?  Oh--well, I dare say Jeffreys could tell you about him.  The fact is, Miss Atherton, if I am not allowed to talk of people behind their backs it is impossible for me to tell you the story of poor young Forrester.""  ""Then,"" said Raby, flushing, as she folded up the paper, ""I've no desire to hear it.""  Scarfe could see he had gone too far.  ""I have offended you,"" said he, ""but really I came upon the name so unexpectedly that--""  ""Do you expect to be working hard this term at Oxford?"" said Raby, doing the kindest thing in turning the conversation.  It was hardly to be wondered at if she retired that night considerably perplexed and disturbed.  There was some mystery attaching to Jeffreys, which, if she was to set any store by Scarfe's insinuations, was of a disgraceful kind.  And the agitation which both Scarfe and Jeffreys had shown on reading the telegram seemed to connect this Captain Forrester, or rather his son, whom Scarfe spoke of as ""poor young Forrester,"" with the same mystery.  Raby was a young lady with the usual allowance of feminine curiosity, which, though she was charity itself, did not like to be baulked by a mystery.  She therefore opened a letter she had just finished to her father, to add the following postscript:--  ""Was this brave Captain Forrester who saved the guns a friend of yours? Tell me all about him.  Had he a wife and children?  Surely something will be done for them, poor things.""  Early next morning Mrs Scarfe and her son left Wildtree.  Jeffreys, from Percy's window, watched them drive away.  ""Very glad you must be to see the back of them,"" said Percy.  ""I am glad,"" responded Jeffreys honestly.  ""I'm not so frightfully sorry,"" said Percy.  ""Scarfe's a jolly enough chap, but he's up to too many dodges, don't you know?  And he's dead on Raby, too.  Quite as dead as you are, Jeff.""  ""Percy, a fortnight's congestion has not cured you of the bad habit of talking nonsense,"" said Jeffreys.  ""All very well, you old humbug, but you know you are, aren't you?""  ""Your cousin is very good and kind, and no one could help liking her. Everybody is `dead on her,' as you call it, even Walker.""  Percy enjoyed this, and allowed himself to be led off the dangerous topic.  He was allowed to sit up for the first time this day, and held a small _levee_ in his room.  Jeffreys took the opportunity to escape for a short time to the library, which he had scarcely been in since the day on the mountain.  He knew Mrs Rimbolt would enjoy her visit to the sick-chamber better without him, and he decidedly preferred his beloved books to her majestic society.  Percy, however, was by no means satisfied with the arrangement.  ""Where's old Jeff?"" said he presently, when his mother, Raby, and he were left alone.  ""Raby, go and tell Jeff, there's a brick.  You can bet he's in the library.  Tell him if he means to cut me dead, he might break it gently.""  ""Raby,"" said Mrs Rimbolt, as her niece, with a smile, started on his majesty's errand, ""I do not choose for you to go looking about for Mr Jeffreys.  There is a bell in the room, and Walker can do it if required.  It is unseemly in a young lady.""  ""One would think old Jeff was a wild beast or a nigger by the way you talk,"" said Percy complainingly.  ""All I know is, if it hadn't been for him, you'd all have been in deep mourning now, instead of having tea up here with me.""  ""It is quite possible, Percy,"" said his mother, ""for a person--""  ""Person!"" interrupted the boy.  ""Jeff's not a person; he's a gentleman. As good as any of us, only he hasn't got so much money.""  ""I fear, Percy, your illness has not improved your good manners.  I wish to say that Mr Jeffreys may have done you service--""  ""I should think he has,"" interrupted the irrepressible one.  ""But it by no means follows that he is a proper companion for a good innocent boy like you.""  Percy laughed hilariously.  ""Really, ma, you are coming it strong.  Do you see my blushes, Raby?""  ""You must make up your mind to see a great deal less of Mr Jeffreys for the future; he is not the sort of person--""  ""Look here, ma,"" said Percy, terrifying his parent by the energy with which he sprang to his feet.  ""I'm jolly ill, and you'd be awfully sorry if I had a fit of coughing and brought up blood, wouldn't you?  Well, I shall if you call Jeff a person again.  Where _is_ Jeff, I say?  I want Jeff.  Why don't you tell him, Raby?""  After this, for a season at any rate, Percy was allowed to have his own way, and jeopardised his moral welfare by unrestricted intercourse with the ""person"" Jeffreys.  They spent their time not wholly unprofitably.  For, besides a good deal of reading of history and classics (for which Percy was rapidly developing a considerable taste), and a good deal of discussion on all sorts of topics, they were deep in constructing the model of a new kind of bookcase, designed by Percy, with some ingenious contrivances for keeping out dust and for marking, by means of automatic signals, the place of any book which should be taken from its shelf.  This wonderful work of art promised to eclipse every bookcase ever invented.  The only drawback to it was that it was too good.  Percy insisted on introducing into it every ""dodge"" of which he was capable, and the poor model more than once threatened to collapse under the burden of its own ingenuity. However, they stuck to it, and by dint of sacrificing a ""dodge"" here and a ""dodge"" there, they succeeded in producing a highly curious and not unworthy model, which Percy was most urgent that his father should forthwith adopt for his library, all the existing bookcases being sacrificed for firewood to make way for the new ones.  Mr Rimbolt diplomatically promised to give the matter his consideration, and consult authorities on the subject when next in London, and meanwhile was not unsparing in his compliments to the inventor and his coadjutor.  So the time passed happily enough for Jeffreys, until about three weeks after the Scarfes' departure, when the following amiable letter reached him with the Oxford post-mark on the envelope:--  Christ Church, _February 20th_.  ""Jeffreys,--You may have supposed that because I left Wildtree without showing you up in your proper character as a murderer and a hypocrite, that I have changed my opinions as to what is my duty to Mr Rimbolt and his family in this matter.  It is not necessary for me to explain to you why I did not do it at once, especially after the blackguardly manner in which you acted on the last evening of my stay there.  You being Mr Rimbolt's servant, I had to consider his convenience.  I now write to say that you can spare me the unpleasant duty of informing the Wildtree household of what a miscreant they have in their midst by doing it yourself.  If, after they know all, they choose to keep you on, there is nothing more to be said.  You are welcome to the chance you will have of lying in order to whitewash yourself, but either I or you must tell what we know.  Meanwhile I envy you the feelings with which I dare say you read of the death of poor young Forrester's father in Afghanistan.  How your cowardly crime must have brightened his last hours!  ""Yours,--  ""E.  Scarfe.""  Jeffreys pitched this elegant specimen of polite Billingsgate contemptuously into the grate.  He was not much a man of the world, but he could read through the lines of a poor performance like this.  Scarfe, for some reason or other, did not like to tell the Rimbolts himself, but he was most anxious they should know, and desired Jeffreys to do the dirty work himself.  There was something almost amusing in the artlessness of the suggestion, and had the subject been less personally grievous, Jeffreys could have afforded to scoff at the whole business.  He sat down on the impulse of the moment and dashed off the following reply:--  ""Dear Scarfe,--Would it not be a pity that your sense of duty should not have the satisfaction of doing its own work, instead of begging me to do it for you?  I may be all you say, but I am not mean enough to rob you of so priceless a jewel as the good conscience of a man who has done his duty.  So I respectfully decline your invitation, and am,--  ""Yours,--  ""J.  Jeffreys.""  Having relieved himself by writing it, he tore the note up, and tried to forget all about it.  But that was not quite so easy.  Scarfe's part in the drama he could not forget, but the question faced him, not for the first time.  Had he any right to be here, trusted, and by some of the family even respected? Was he not sailing under false colours, and pretending to be something he was not?  True, he had been originally engaged as a librarian, a post in which character was accounted of less importance than scholarship and general proficiency.  But he was more than a librarian now.  Circumstances had made him the mentor and companion of a high-spirited, honest boy.  Was it fair to Percy to keep a secret what would certainly shut the doors of Wildtree against him for ever?  Was it fair to Mr Rimbolt to accept this new responsibility without a word?  Was it fair to Raby, who would shrink from him with detestation, did she know the whole story?  Scarfe would have been amply satisfied had he been present to note the disquietude which ensued for some days after the arrival of his letter. Jeffreys felt uncomfortable in his intercourse with Mr Rimbolt; he avoided Raby, and even with Percy he was often unaccountably reserved and pensive.  ""What are you in the blues about?"" demanded that quick-sighted young gentleman on the first day out of doors after his illness.  ""Are you sorry I'm all serene again?""  ""Rather,"" said Jeffreys; ""it's not been a bad time.""  ""No more it has; but I must say I don't mind feeling my legs under me. I shall soon be ready for the top of Wild Pike again.  But, I say, aren't you well?  I expect you've been knocking yourself up over me?""  ""Not a bit of it; I'm as well as anything.""  Percy, however, was not satisfied.  He had a vague idea that young gentlemen in love were as a rule sickly, and by a simple process of reasoning he guessed that Jeffreys and Raby ""had had a row.""  He therefore took an early opportunity of mentioning the matter to his cousin, greatly to that young lady's confusion.  ""Raby, I say, look here!"" he began, a day or two afterwards, as he and his cousin were walking together.  ""What makes you so jolly down on Jeff?""  ""I down on Mr Jeffreys?  What do you mean?""  ""Well, he's so dismal, I'm certain he's eating his heart out about you! Why don't you back him up?  He's a good enough chap and no end of a brick, and say what you will, he meant to fish you out that day on the ice.  He went off like a shot directly after the ice cracked.""  ""Percy, you ridiculous boy!"" said Raby, biting her lips; ""how can you talk such nonsense?""  ""Oh! but he did,"" persisted the boy.  ""I'm not talking about the ice,"" said she.  ""Mr Jeffreys and I are very good friends; chiefly on your account, too,"" added she, with a vague idea of qualifying her admission.  ""Oh, ah, that won't wash, you know,"" said Percy.  ""Anyhow, it's nonsense you being so precious stiff with him; I'm sure he's as good as Scarfe.""  ""Percy, if you cannot talk sense,"" said Raby, nearly crying with vexation, ""I shall not listen to you.""  ""Oh, all serene!"" responded Percy.  ""Of course you're bound to make out it's all humbug, but I know better.  Come, don't be in a rage, Raby; you forget I'm an invalid.""  So they made it up on the spot, and Percy flattered himself he had done a great deal to make things right for Jeffreys.  Jeffreys, however, was still harassed by perplexity, and was gradually veering round to the conclusion that he must at all costs relieve his mind of his secret to Mr Rimbolt.  He put the task off day after day, shrinking from the wrench of all the ties which made his life happy.  One day, however, finding himself alone with Mr Rimbolt in the library, he suddenly resolved then and there to speak out.  ""Oh, Jeffreys,"" began Mr Rimbolt, ""I am very anxious to get those books from the Wanley Abbey sale looked through and catalogued within the next few days if you can manage it.  We all go up to London, you know, next week, and I should be glad to have all square before we start.""  ""I have no doubt they can all be gone through before then.""  ""I should like you to come to town, too,"" said Mr Rimbolt.  ""Percy sets great store by your companionship; besides which, there are some very important book sales coming on in which I shall want your help.""  ""I had been going to ask you--"" began Jeffreys, feeling his temples throbbing like two steam-engines.  ""Oh, by the way,"" interrupted Mr Rimbolt, taking a letter from his pocket, ""did not you tell me you were at a school called Bolsover?""  ""Yes,"" faltered Jeffreys, wondering what was coming.  ""It's very odd.  I have a letter from an old Oxford acquaintance of mine, called Frampton, who appears to be head-master there, and whom I have never heard of for about sixteen years.  He is fond of books, and writes to ask if he may come and see the library.  I've asked him to stay a night, and expect him here to-morrow.  I dare say you will be glad to meet him.  Perhaps he knows you are here?""  ""No, I don't think so,"" said Jeffreys.  ""Ah, then I dare say you will be glad to see one another again.""  Jeffreys was considerably staggered by this unexpected announcement, but it relieved him of all present perplexity as to speaking to Mr Rimbolt of young Forrester.  He would at least wait till Mr Frampton came, and put himself in his hands.  Mr Frampton came, as young and fresh as ever.  He was taking a three days' run in the Lake country during a term holiday, and, determined to do and see all he could, had decided to visit his old college friend, and look over the now famous Wildtree library.  His surprise at meeting Jeffreys was very considerable; and at first it seemed to the quondam pupil that his old master was shy of him.  This, however, was explained as soon as they were alone, and had to do with the seven pounds, which had burned holes in Mr Frampton's pockets ever since he received them, but which, not knowing Jeffreys' address, he had never been able to return.  ""I was never more pained than when I received this money,"" said he. ""Your guardian was written to by the clerk in ordinary course, but I never imagined the bill would be passed on to you.""  Jeffreys had nothing for it but to take the money back, much as he disliked it.  Until he did so, Mr Frampton was too fidgety to be approachable on any other subject.  The morning after his arrival, they went up Wild Pike together--the first time Jeffreys had been on the mountain since the death of Julius. They had a fine day and no difficulty; but the long talk which beguiled the way amply made up to Jeffreys for the lack of adventure.  Mr Frampton told him much about Bolsover, and of how it was at last beginning to thrive and recover from the dry-rot; how this winter the football team had got up a name for itself; how the school discussion society was crowded with members; how the cricket prospects were decidedly hopeful; and how two fellows had lately gained scholarships at Oxford.  Then he began to ask Jeffreys about himself, and got from him a full account of all that had befallen him since he left school.  Mr Frampton was a most sympathetic listener, and the poor ""dog with a bad name,"" who had almost forgotten the art of speaking his mind fully to any one, warmed insensibly to this friend as they talked, and reproached himself for the pride and shortsightedness which had induced him to shut himself out so long from his friendship.  Then they talked of young Forrester.  Mr Frampton made no attempt to gloss over the wickedness of that unhappy act of passion.  But he showed how fully he made allowances for the poor blundering offender, and how he, at least, saw more to pity than to upbraid in it all.  He knew nothing of young Forrester's fate.  He had seen in the papers the notice of Captain Forrester's death, from whom, months before, he had had a letter of inquiry as to his son's whereabouts, and to whom he had written telling all he knew, which was but little.  Then Jeffreys unfolded his present uncomfortable dilemma, and his intention of speaking to Mr Rimbolt, and they talked it over very seriously and anxiously.  At last Mr Frampton said,--  ""Let me speak to Mr Rimbolt.""  ""Most thankfully I will.""  So Mr Frampton spoke to Mr Rimbolt, and told him frankly all there was to tell, and Mr Rimbolt, like a gentleman who knew something of Christian charity, joined his informant in pitying the offender.  ""Jeffreys,"" said he, the day after Mr Frampton's departure, ""your friend has told me a story about you which I heard with great sorrow. You are now doing all that an honest man can do, with God's help, to make up for what is past.  What I have been told does not shake my present confidence in you in any way, and I need not tell you that not a single person in this house beyond yourself and me shall know anything about this unhappy affair.""    CHAPTER TWENTY ONE.  ""GOING IT.""  Jeffreys started for London with a lighter heart than he had known since he first came to Wildtree.  When he contrasted his present sense of relief with the oppression which had preceded it, he marvelled how he could ever have gone on so long, dishonestly nursing his wretched secret under Mr Rimbolt's roof.  Now, in the first reaction of relief, he was tempted to believe his good name was really come back, and that Mr Rimbolt having condoned his offence, the memory of Bolsover was cancelled.  It was a passing temptation only.  Alas! that memory clung still. Nothing could alter the past; and though he might now feel secure from its consequences, he had only to think of young Forrester to remind him that somewhere the black mark stood against his name as cruelly as ever.  Yet, comparatively, he felt light-hearted, as with the Rimbolt family he stood at last on the London platform.  It was new ground to him.  Some years ago Mr Halgrove had lived several months in the Metropolis, and the boy, spending his summer holidays there, and left entirely to his own devices, had learned in a plodding way about as much of the great city as a youth of seventeen could well do in the time.  The Rimbolts' house in Clarges Street was to Jeffreys' mind not nearly so cheerful as Wildtree.  The library in it consisted of a small collection of books, chiefly political, for Mr Rimbolt's use in his parliamentary work; and the dark little room allotted to him, with its look-out on the mews, was dull indeed compared with the chamber at Wildtree, from which he could at least see the mountain.  Nor did he by any means enjoy the constant round of entertainments which went on in London, at which he was sometimes called upon in a humble way to assist.  He had been obliged, in deference to Mrs Rimbolt's broad hints, to buy a dress suit, and in this he was expected on occasions to present himself at the end of a grand dinner-party, or when Mr Rimbolt required his professional attendance.  For, there being no books to take care of here, Mr Rimbolt availed himself of his librarian's services as a private secretary in some important political business, and found him so efficient and willing, that he proposed to him a considerable increase in his salary, in consideration of his permanently undertaking a good share of his employer's ordinary correspondence.  The chief portion of Jeffreys' time, however, still belonged to Percy, and it was a decided relief to him that that young gentleman scoffed at and eschewed the endless hospitalities and entertainments with which his mother delighted to fill up their life in London.  ""I don't see the fun of gorging night after night, do you, Jeff?  A good spread's all very well now and again, but you get sick of it seven nights a week.  Makes me sleepy.  Then all these shows and things!  I've a good mind to get laid up again, and have a real good time.  There's to be no end of a crowd here to-night--everybody.  I shall cut it if I can; shan't you?""  ""Mr Rimbolt wants me to come into the drawing-room after dinner,"" said Jeffreys.  ""All serene!  That won't be till nine.  Come up to Putney, and have a row on the river this afternoon.""  Percy was an enthusiastic oarsman, and many an afternoon Jeffreys and he, flying from the crowd, had spent on the grand old Thames.  Jeffreys enjoyed it as much as he, and no one, seeing the boy and his tutor together in their pair-oar, would have imagined that the broader of the two was that ungainly lout who had once been an object of derision in the Bolsover meadows.  The party that evening was, as Percy predicted, a very large one, and Jeffreys had the discomfort of recognising a few of the guests who last autumn had helped to make his position so painful.  They, to do them justice, did not now add to his discomfort by recognising him.  Even the lady who had given him that half-crown appeared wholly to have forgotten the object of her charity.  What, however, made him most uncomfortable was the sight of Mrs Scarfe, and hearing her say to Percy, ""Edward is coming on Saturday, Percy; he is looking forward with such pleasure to taking you about to see the University sports and the Boat Race.  Your dear mamma has kindly asked two of his college friends to come too, so you will be quite a merry quartette.""  Jeffreys had nearly forgotten Scarfe's existence of late.  He no longer dreaded him on his own account, but on Percy's he looked forward to Saturday with dismay.  He would have liked to know also, as a mere matter of curiosity of course, what Raby thought about the promised visit.  His own communications with that young lady had not been very frequent of late, although they continued friendly.  Percy's nonsense gave them both a considerable amount of embarrassment; for although Jeffreys never for a moment supposed that Mr Rimbolt's niece thought twice about him except as a persecuted dependant and a friend to Percy, to have anything else suggested disturbed his shy nature, and made him feel constrained in her presence.  ""You'll have to mind your eye with Raby now that Scarfe's coming,"" said Percy that night.  ""You bet he'll try to hook her.  I heard his mother flying kites with ma about it, to see how the land lies.""  Jeffreys had given up the formality of pretending, when Percy launched out on this delicate subject, not to know what he was talking about.  ""Whatever Scarfe does,"" said he, ""is nothing to me.""  ""What I don't you and Raby hit it off, then?""  ""Hit what off?""  ""I mean aren't you dead on her, don't you know?--spoons, and all that sort of thing?""  ""I am not aware that I entertain feelings towards anybody which could be described by any article of cutlery at all.""  ""Well, all I can say is, when I blowed her up for being down on you, she blushed up no end, and cried too.  I should like to know what you call that, if it isn't spoons?""  ""I think it would be kinder, Percy, if you did not talk to your cousin about me; and I fancy she would as soon you did not talk about her to me.""  ""Well, that's rather what I should call a shut-up,"" said Percy.  ""It bothers me how people that like one another get so precious shy of letting the other fellow know it.  I know I shan't.  I'll have it out at once, before any other chap comes and cuts me out.""  With which valiant determination Percy earned Jeffreys' gratitude by relapsing into silence.  He was, however, destined to have the uncomfortable topic revived in another and more unexpected quarter.  On the day before Scarfe's proposed visit, Walker accosted him as he was going out, with the announcement that my lady would like to speak to him in the morning-room.  This rare summons never failed to wring a groan from the depths of the librarian's spirit, and it did now as he proceeded to the torture- chamber.  The lady was alone, and evidently burdened with the importance of the occasion.  ""Mr Jeffreys,"" said she, with a tone of half conciliation which put up Jeffreys' back far more than her usual severe drawl, ""kindly take a seat; I wish to speak to you.""  ""It's all up with me!"" groaned the unhappy Jeffreys inwardly, as he obeyed.  Mrs Rimbolt gathered herself together, and began.  ""I desire to speak to you, Mr Jeffreys, in reference to my niece, Miss Atherton, who, in her father's absence, is here under my protection and parental control.""  Jeffreys flushed up ominously.  ""It does not please me, Mr Jeffreys, to find you, occupying, as you do, the position of a dependant in this house, so far forgetting yourself as to consider that there is anything in your respective positions which justifies you in having communications with Miss Atherton other than those of a respectful stranger.""  Jeffreys found himself frivolously thinking this elaborate sentence would be an interesting exercise in parsing for the head class at Galloway House.  He barely took in that the remarks were intended for him at all, and his abstracted look apparently disconcerted Mrs Rimbolt.  ""I must request your attention, Mr Jeffreys,"" said she severely.  ""I beg your pardon.  I am all attention.""  ""I am quite willing to suppose,"" continued she, ""that it is ignorance on your part rather than intentional misconduct which has led you into this; but from henceforth I wish it to be clearly understood that I shall expect you to remember your proper station in this house.  Miss Atherton, let me tell you, has no need of your attentions.  You perfectly understand me, Mr Jeffreys?""  Jeffreys bowed, still rather abstractedly.  ""You do not reply to my question, Mr Jeffreys.""  ""I perfectly understand you, madam.""  ""I trust I shall not have to speak to you again.""  ""I trust not,"" said Jeffreys, with a fervour which startled the lady.  He left the room, outraged, insulted, sorely tempted to shake the dust of the place once and for all from off his feet.  The evil temper within him once more asserted itself as he flung himself into his room, slamming the door behind him with a force that made the whole house vibrate.  The narrow room was insupportable.  It stifled him.  He must get out into the fresh air or choke.  On the doorstep he met Mr Rimbolt, alighting from his brougham.  ""Oh, Jeffreys, so glad to have caught you.  Look here.  I find I must be in the House to-night and to-morrow, and I intended to go down to Exeter to attend that four days' sale of Lord Waterfield's library.  I must get you to go for me.  You have the catalogue we went through together, with the lots marked which I must have.  I have put an outside price against some, and the others must be mine at any price--you understand.  Stick at nothing.  Take plenty of money with you for travelling and expenses. Do things comfortably, and I will give you a blank cheque for the books. Mind I must have them, if it comes to four figures.  Go down by the Flying Dutchman to-night, and send me a telegram at the end of each day to say what you have secured.""  The proposal came opportunely to Jeffreys.  He was in the humour of accepting anything for a change; and this _carte blanche_ proposal, and the responsibility it involved, contained a spice of excitement which suited with his present mood.  He went down to Exeter that night, trying to think of nothing but Lord Waterfield's books, and to forget all about Raby, and Percy, and Mrs Rimbolt, and Scarfe.  The last-named hero and his two friends duly presented themselves at Clarges Street next day.  Scarfe was in great good-humour with himself, and even his antipathies to the world at large were decidedly modified by the discovery that Jeffreys was out of town.  His two friends were of the gay and festive order--youths who would have liked to be considered fast, but betrayed constantly that they did not yet know the way how.  Percy, with his usual facile disposition, quickly fell into the ways of the trio, and rather enjoyed the luxury of now and then getting a rise out of the undergrads by showing that ""he knew a thing or two"" himself.  They spent their first few days together in ""going it""--that is, in seeing and doing all they could.  Scarfe's friends began shyly, feeling their way both with their host and hostess and with their son.  But then they saw that Mr Rimbolt was far too engrossed to think of anything beyond that they should all enjoy themselves and do as they liked--when they saw that Mrs Rimbolt swore by Scarfe, and, to use the choice language of one of them, ""didn't sit up at anything as long as the Necktie was in it""--and when they saw that Percy was a cool hand, and, whatever he thought, did not let himself be startled by anything, these two ingenuous youths plucked up heart and ""let out all round.""  They haunted billiard saloons, but failed to delude any one into the belief that they knew one end of a cue from another.  They went to theatres, where the last thing they looked at was the stage.  They played cards without being quite sure what was the name of the game they played.  They smoked cigars, which it was well for their juvenile stomachs were ""warranted extra mild""; and they drank wine which neither made glad their hearts nor improved their digestions; and they spiced their conversation with big words which they did not know the meaning of themselves, and would certainly have never found explained in the dictionary.  Percy, after a few days, got sick of it.  He had never ""gone it"" in this style before; and finding out what it meant, he didn't see much fun in it.  Late hours and unwholesome food and never-ending ""sport"" did not agree with him.  He had looked forward to seeing a lot of the boat practice on the river, and hearing a lot about University sport and life.  But in this he was disappointed.  The ""boats"" were voted a nuisance; and whenever the talk turned on Oxford it was instantly tabooed as ""shop.""  Scarfe sneered to him in private about these two fools, but when with them he ""went it"" with the rest, and made no protest.  ""Percy,"" said Raby, two or three days after this sort of thing had been going on, ""you look wretchedly pale and tired.  Why do you stay out so late every night?""  ""Oh,"" said Percy wearily, ""I don't know--we humbug about.  Nothing very bad.""  ""If it makes you ill and wretched, I say it is bad, Percy,"" said the girl.  ""Oh, I don't know.  Scarfe goes in for it, you know.""  ""I don't care a bit who goes in for it.  It's bad.""  ""You don't mean to say you think Scarfe is a bad lot?""  ""Don't speak to me of Mr Scarfe.  I hate him for this!""  Percy whistled.  ""Hullo, I say! here's a go!"" he cried.  ""Then you're really spoons on Jeff after all?  How awfully glad he'll be when I tell him!""  ""Percy I shall hate _you_ if you talk like that!"" said the girl.  ""I hate any one who is not good to you; and it is certainly not good to you to lead you into folly and perhaps wickedness.""  This protest had its effect on Percy.  The next day he struck, and pleaded an excuse for accompanying the precious trio on an expedition to Windsor, to be consummated by a champagne supper at the ""Christopher.""  They urged him hard, and tempted him sorely by the prospect of a row on the river and any amount of fun.  He declined stubbornly.  He was fagged, and not in the humour.  Awfully sorry to back out and all that, but he couldn't help it, and wanted to save up for the Sports and Boat Race on Friday and Saturday.  They gave him up as a bad job, and started without him.  He watched them go without much regret, and then, putting on his hat, walked off towards Paddington to meet Jeffreys, who was due in about an hour.  The quiet walk through the streets rather revived him; and the prospect of seeing Jeffreys again was still more refreshing.  Of course he knew he should have to tell him of his folly, and Jeff would ""sit on him"" in his solemn style.  Still, that was better than getting his head split open with cigars, and having to laugh at a lot of trashy jokes.  Jeffreys was delighted to see him; and the two were leaving Paddington arm-in-arm when Scarfe and his two friends, alighting from a cab, suddenly confronted them.    CHAPTER TWENTY TWO.  THE BAD NAME.  Percy was riotously greeted by Scarfe's two friends.  ""Hullo, old man!"" cried one of them; ""then you thought better of it, after all, and mean to join us!  That's the style!""  ""Bring your handsome friend with you.  More the merrier.  There'll be champagne enough for the lot.""  ""Look alive,"" said Percy; ""you'll lose your train.  Jeff and I aren't coming.""  ""Why not?"" said they.  ""Because we're going the other way,"" replied Percy, who, when his mind was made up, did not appreciate anybody's importunity.  ""I've not seen Jeff for a week.""  ""Who is this precious Jeff?"" said one of Scarfe's friends, pointing over his shoulder to the librarian.  ""He's a gentleman employed by the month to look after Percy's morals,"" said Scarfe, with a sneer.  ""A parson!  What a game!  No wonder Percy draws in his horns a bit when he comes home.  Anyhow, we must save him from the paws of the lion if we can.  I say, Percy, you must come, old man.  We made all the arrangements for four, boat and everything; and if you don't want to stay late we'll give up the supper.  Only don't spoil our day, there's a good fellow.  You'll be able to see lots of your friend when we've gone.""  ""You be hanged,"" observed Percy, now in an uncomplimentary mood; ""haven't I told you I'm not coming?  What more do you want?""  ""Oh, of course, if you're so taken up with this reverend thing of beauty,"" said one of them sulkily, ""we're out of it.  I should have thought he could have snuffled to himself for a day without wanting you to help him.""  Scarfe all this time stood by in a rage.  The sight of Jeffreys was to him like the dead fly in the apothecary's ointment.  It upset him and irritated him with everybody and everything.  He had guessed, on receiving no reply to his recent polite letter, that he had exposed his own poor hand to his enemy, and he hated him accordingly with a double hatred.  He contrived, however, to keep up an appearance of scornful indifference.  ""You are still reaping the rewards of virtue, pious homicide,"" he sneered.  ""I still envy the upright man who does his duty,"" replied Jeffreys, scarcely less bitterly.  ""What do you mean, you--""  ""I mean what I say,"" said Jeffreys, turning on his heel, and taking Percy's arm.  They walked home, and before Clarges Street was reached Percy had told his friend an unvarnished story of the follies of the last few days, and enlisted his support in his determination to pull up.  There was something touching in the mingled shame and anger of the proud boy as he made his confession, not sparing himself, and full of scorn at those who had tempted him.  Jeffreys was full of righteous wrath on his behalf, and ran up a score against Scarfe which would have astonished that worthy, listlessly loafing about at Windsor, had he guessed it.  ""I've promised to go and see the Boat Race with them,"" said Percy; ""but you must come too.  I know you'll hate it, and so will they; but somehow I can't do without a little backing up.""  ""I'll back you up, old fellow, all I can, I only wish,"" added he, for the boy's confidence in him humiliated him, ""I had a better right to do it.""  ""Why, Jeff, I don't suppose you ever did a bad thing in your life.""  ""Don't say that,"" said Jeffreys almost appealingly, ""I have!""  The boy looked up at him, startled for a moment by his tone.  Then he said, with a return of his old look of confidence--  ""Poor old Jeff!  That's what makes you so blue sometimes.  If it weren't for you, I'd have a precious good right to be in the blues too.""  Jeffreys, who had not entered the house since his interview with Mrs Rimbolt, felt anything but comfortable as he again set foot within it; and had it not been for Percy's countenance, he would have felt it still more of an ordeal.  He had, however, plenty to occupy his mind during the hour or two which followed.  Mr Rimbolt was waiting for him eagerly, to hear all about the sale and the purchases which had been made.  ""You've done a capital stroke of business for me, Jeffreys,"" said he, when the report had been concluded.  ""Those three Caxtons I would not have missed for anything.  I am quite glad that business will take me North next week, as I shall be able to run over to Wildtree and see some of the treasures unpacked.  I shall, however, leave them for you finally to arrange when we all go back in June.  You've seen Percy?  I fancy he has been racketing rather too much with these friends of his; but I imagine Scarfe would see he went into no mischief.  However, I am glad you have come back, for the boy's sake, as you understand him.  This summer I think you should take him a little run in Normandy or Switzerland.  It would do him good, and you, too, to knock about abroad for a week or two.  However, there's time enough to talk about that. And I dare say you will be glad now to get a little rest after your journey.""  Jeffreys returned to his room very contentedly.  The confidence Mr Rimbolt reposed in him was soothing to his spirits, and went far to obliterate the memory of that hideous interview last week.  Percy was out when, after washing and changing his travelling garb, he came down to the morning-room, which he usually occupied during the afternoon.  To his surprise, and even consternation, Raby was there, writing.  She rose, brightly, almost radiantly, as he entered.  ""Oh, Mr Jeffreys, how glad I am to see you back!  Poor Percy has been in such want of you!  These Oxford friends of his, I am certain, have not been doing him any good.  Have you seen him?  I am so happy you have come back!""  Jeffreys was not made of adamant, and a greeting like this, even though it was offered on some one else's behalf, was enough to drive Mrs Rimbolt completely out of his head.  ""I am very fortunate to be able to make you happy so easily,"" said he. ""Yes, I have seen Percy, and heard all his troubles.  How could any one help being grateful for a confidence like his?  You know, Miss Atherton, I would do anything for him.""  ""I believe you,"" said she warmly.  ""You are good and unselfish.""  ""Do you mind my saying,"" said Jeffreys, colouring, ""that it is an additional pleasure to do what I can for Percy if it makes you happy?""  ""I don't mind your saying it if it is true.  It does make me happy.""  And her face was the best witness to her sincerity.  Jeffreys was not the only person who saw that bright smile.  Mrs Rimbolt, entering the room at that moment, saw it too, and heard the words which it accompanied.  She glared round witheringly on Jeffreys.  ""So, Mr Jeffreys, _you_ are here.  What brings you here?""  ""Mr Jeffreys--"" began Raby, feeling and looking very confused.  ""Silence, Raby, I asked Mr Jeffreys.""  ""I came here not knowing the room was occupied.  It was a pleasant surprise to find Miss Atherton here, and she has been making me happy by talking to me about Percy.""  ""Mr Jeffreys,"" said the lady, ""allow me to say I do not believe you.""  ""Auntie!"" exclaimed Raby, firing up in a manner unusual to her; ""it is true.  Mr Jeffreys always tells the truth!""  ""Raby, my dear, you had better leave the room.""  ""No, auntie!"" exclaimed the girl.  ""You have no right to charge Mr Jeffreys with saying what is not true.  It's not fair--it's wrong--it's wicked!""  ""You forget, my dear, of all persons you should not address me like this.""  ""No,"" said the girl, going to the door, which Jeffreys opened for her. ""I don't forget, and I shall not forget.  You have no right to say it. I wish father was home again, and would take me away!""  In the midst of his own indignation, Jeffreys could not help admiring this outbreak of righteous indignation on the part of the spirited girl.  Mrs Rimbolt little guessed how much she herself was doing to defeat her own ends.  ""Mr Jeffreys,"" said she, after Raby had gone, ""after our interview last week, your conduct is both disgraceful and dishonourable.  I should not have believed it even of you.""  ""Pardon me, madam.  You have charged me with telling you a lie just now. Is that so?""  His tone was strangely peremptory.  Mrs Rimbolt had never seen him like this before--and for the moment it disconcerted her.  ""What I heard as I entered the room had no reference to Percy,"" said she.  ""Excuse me--it had.  Miss Atherton--""  ""If it had, I must believe you.  I wish to hear no more about it.  But after your promise last week--""  ""I made no promise, and should decline to do so.  I am quite aware of my position here, and am ready to give it up when called upon.  But while I stay here and do my work, Mrs Rimbolt, I claim to be protected from insult.""  ""It is useless to prolong this interview, Mr Jeffreys,"" said Mrs Rimbolt, half-scared by the turn things had taken.  ""I never expected to be addressed in this way in my own house by one who is dependent on my husband for his living.  You can leave me, sir.""  Jeffreys bowed, and retired to his room, where he awaited as calmly as he could what appeared to him the inevitable end of the scene--a notice to quit.  But it did not come.  Mrs Rimbolt knew herself to be in the wrong.  Her husband, she knew, if she laid the case before him, would judicially inquire into its merits, and come to the same conclusion.  In that case her dominion would be at an end.  Even the Mrs Rimbolts have an eye to the better half of valour sometimes, and so Jeffreys was left sitting for an ultimatum which did not come.  Raby had a still worse ordeal before her.  At first her indignation had reigned supreme and effaced all other emotions.  Gradually, however, a feeling of vague misery ensued.  She longed to be away in India with her dear soldier father; she wished Jeffreys had never come under the Wildtree roof to bring insult on himself and wretchedness to her.  She dreaded the future for her boy cousin without his protector, and half wished him dead and safe from temptation.  In due time her brave spirit came back.  She despised herself for her weakness, and, resolved boldly to face her aunt and every one, she came down to dinner.  It was strictly a family party, with Mrs Scarfe added; for the other three visitors had not yet returned from Windsor.  Raby sought protection from her aunt by devoting herself to Mrs Scarfe, and quite delighted that good lady by her brightness and spirit.  Mrs Scarfe took occasion in the drawing-room afterwards to go into rhapsodies to her young friend regarding her son; and when about ten o'clock the holiday- makers arrived home, in high spirits and full of their day's sport, she achieved a grand stroke of generalship by leaving the two young people together in the conservatory, having previously, by a significant pressure of her son's arm, given him to understand that now was his time for striking while the iron was hot.  Scarfe was in an unusually gay mood, and still a little elevated by the festivities of the day.  ""I'm sure you missed us,"" said he, ""didn't you?""  ""The house was certainly much quieter,"" said Raby.  ""Do you know,"" said he, ""it's rather pleasant to feel that one is missed?""  Raby said nothing, but began to feel a desire to be safely back in the drawing-room.  ""Do you know we drank toasts to-day, like the old knights, to our lady loves?"" continued Scarfe.  ""Indeed,"" replied Raby, as unconcernedly as she could.  ""Yes--and shall I tell you the name I pledged?  Ah, I see you know, Raby.""  ""Mr Scarfe, I want to go back to the drawing-room; please take me.""  Scarfe took her hand.  His head was swimming, partly with excitement, partly with the effects of the supper.  ""Not till I tell you I love you, and--""  ""Mr Scarfe, I don't want to hear all this,"" said Raby, snatching her hand away angrily, and moving to the door.  He seized it again rudely.  ""You mean you don't care for me?"" asked he.  ""I want to go away,"" said she.  ""Tell me first,"" said he, detaining her; ""do you mean you will not have me--that you don't love me?""  ""I don't,"" said she.  ""Then,"" said he, sober enough now, and standing between her and the door, ""there is another question still Is the reason because some one else in this house has--""  ""Mr Scarfe,"" said Raby quietly, ""don't you think, when I ask you to let me go, it is not quite polite of you to prevent me?""  ""Please excuse me,"" he said apologetically.  ""I was excited, and forgot; but, Raby, do let me warn you, for your sake, to beware of this fellow Jeffreys.  No, let me speak,"" said he, as she put up her hand to stop him.  ""I will say nothing to offend you.  You say you do not care for me, and I have nothing to gain by telling you this.  If he has--""  ""Mr Scarfe, you are quite mistaken; do, please, let me go.""  Scarfe yielded, bitterly mortified and perplexed.  His vanity had all along only supposed one possible obstacle to his success with Raby, and that was a rival.  That she would decline to have him for any other reason had been quite beyond his calculations, and he would not believe it now.  Jeffreys may not have actually gone as far as to propose to her, but, so it seemed, there was some understanding between them which barred Scarfe's own chance.  The worst of it all was that to do the one thing he would have liked to do would be to spoil his own chance altogether. For Raby, whether she cared for Jeffreys or not, would have nothing to say to Scarfe if he was the means of his ruin.  The air during the next few days seemed charged with thunder.  Mrs Rimbolt was in a state of war with every one, Mrs Scarfe was poorly, the two Oxford visitors began to vote their visit slow, Scarfe was moody, Raby was unhappy, Jeffreys felt continually half-choked, Percy alone kept up his spirits, while Mr Rimbolt, happiest of all, went up North to look at his old books.  No one was particularly sorry when the visits came to an end.  Even the Sports and Boat Race had failed to revive the drooping spirits of the Oxonians, and on the Monday following it was with a considerable stretch of politeness that they all thanked Mrs Rimbolt for a very pleasant visit.  Scarfe, taking farewell of Raby, begged that some time, later on, he might come to see her again, but was quite unable to gather from her reply whether she desired it or not.  Jeffreys wisely kept out of the way while the departures were taking place, despite Mrs Rimbolt's suggestion that he should be sent for to help the cabman carry out the boxes.  The first evening after they were all gone the house seemed another place.  Even Jeffreys felt he could breathe, despite Mr Rimbolt's absence, and the hostile proximity of his lady.  As to Raby and Percy, they made no concealment of the relief they felt, and went off for a row on the river to celebrate the occasion.  Jeffreys judiciously excused himself from accompanying them, and went a long walk by himself.  Two days later, after lunch, just as Percy and Raby had departed for a ride in the park, and Jeffreys had shut himself up in Mr Rimbolt's study to write, a letter was delivered by the post addressed to Mrs Rimbolt, bearing the Oxford post-mark.  It was from Scarfe, and Mrs Rimbolt opened her eyes as she perused it:--  ""Christchurch, _April_ 2.""  Dear Mrs Rimbolt,--I reached here from home this morning, and hasten to send you a line to thank you for the very pleasant visit I spent in London last week.  I should have written sooner, but that I was anxious to write you on another and less pleasant subject, which I felt should not be done hurriedly.  You will, I dare say, blame me for not having told you earlier what I now feel it my duty to tell, and I trust you will understand the feelings which have prevented my doing so.  John Jeffreys, who is in Mr Rimbolt's employment, is, as you know, an old schoolfellow of mine.  I was surprised to see him at Wildtree last Christmas, and took the trouble to inquire whether he had come to you with a character, or whether you had any knowledge of his antecedents. I imagined you had not, and supposed that, as he was only engaged as a librarian, inquiries as to his character were not considered necessary. But when I saw that he was being admitted as a member of your household, and specially allowed to exercise an influence on Percy, I assure you I felt uncomfortable, and it has been on my mind ever since to tell you what I feel you ought to know.  Jeffreys ran away from school after committing a cruel act which, to all intents and purposes, was murder. His victim was a small boy whom we all loved, and who never did him harm.  The details of the whole affair are too horrible to dwell upon here, but I have said enough to show you what sort of person it is who is at present entrusted with the care of your own son, and allowed to associate on a footing of equality with your niece, Miss Atherton.  I can assure you it is very painful to me to write this, for I know how it will shock you.  But I feel my conscience would not give me peace till I told you all.  May I now ask one special favour from you?  It is well known, and you probably have noticed it yourself, that Jeffreys and I naturally dislike one another.  But I want you to believe that I write this, not because I dislike Jeffreys, but because I like you all, and feel that Percy particularly is in peril.  What I ask is that if you think it right to take any action in the matter, my name may not be mentioned.  It would be considered an act of spite on my part, which it is not; and perhaps I may mention to you that I have special reasons for wishing that Miss Atherton, at least, should not think worse of me than I deserve.  She would certainly misunderstand it if my name were mentioned.  I feel I have only done my duty, and I assure you it will be a great relief to me to know that you are rid of one who cannot fail to exercise a fatal influence on the pure and honest mind of my friend Percy.  ""Believe me, dear Mrs Rimbolt, most sincerely yours,--  ""E.  Scarfe.""  The shock which this astounding communication gave to Mrs Rimbolt can be more easily imagined than described.  It explained everything--her instinctive dislike of the man from the first, his moroseness and insolence, and the cunning with which he had insinuated himself first into her husband's and then into Percy's confidence!  How blind she had been not to see it all before!  She might have known that he was a villain!  Now, however, her duty was clear, and she would be wicked if she delayed to act upon it a moment.  If Mr Rimbolt had been at home, it would have fallen on him to discharge it, but he was not, and she must do it for him.  Whereupon this worthy matron girded herself for the fray, and stalked off to the study.  Jeffreys was busy transcribing some bibliographical notes which he had brought away with him from Exeter.  The work was not very engrossing, and he had leisure now and then to let his mind wander, and the direction his thoughts took was towards Mr Rimbolt's little plan of a run on the Continent for Percy and himself this summer.  Jeffreys had been afraid to acknowledge to himself how much the plan delighted him. He longed to see the everlasting snows, and the lakes, and the grand old mediaeval cities, and the prospect of seeing them with Percy, away from all that could annoy or jar--  He had got so far when the door opened, and Mrs Rimbolt stood before him.  The lady was pale, and evidently agitated beyond her wont.  She stood for a moment facing Jeffreys, and apparently waiting for words.  The librarian's back went up in anticipation.  If it was more about Raby, he would leave the room before he forgot himself.  ""Mr Jeffreys,"" said the lady, and her words came slowly and hoarsely, ""I request you to leave this house in half an hour.""  It was Jeffreys' turn to start and grow pale.  ""May I ask why?"" he said.  ""You know why, sir,"" said the lady.  ""You have known why ever since you had the meanness to enter Wildtree on false pretences.""  ""Really, Mrs Rimbolt,"" began Jeffreys, with a cold shudder passing through him, ""I am at a loss--""  ""Don't speak to me, sir!  You knew you had no right to enter the house of honest, respectable people--you knew you had no right to take advantage of an accident to insinuate yourself into this family, and impose upon the unsuspecting good-nature of my husband.  No one asked you for your character; for no one imagined you could be quite so hypocritical as you have been.  You, the self-constituted friend and protector of my precious boy--you, with the stain of blood on your hands and the mark of Cain on your forehead!  Leave my house at once; I desire no words.  You talked grandly about claiming to be protected from insult in this house.  It is we who claim to be protected from a hypocrite and a murderer!  Begone; and consider yourself fortunate that instead of walking out a free man, you are not taken out to the punishment you deserve!""  When Jeffreys, stunned and stupefied, looked up, the room was empty.  Mechanically he finished a sentence he had been writing, then letting the pen drop from his hand, sat where he was, numbed body and soul. Mrs Rimbolt's words dinned in his ears, and with them came those old haunting sounds, the yells on the Bolsover meadows, the midnight shriek of the terrified boy, the cold sneer of his guardian, the brutal laugh of Jonah Trimble.  All came back in one confused hideous chorus, yelling to him that his bad name was alive still, dogging him down, down, mocking his foolish dreams of deliverance and hope, hounding him out into the night to hide his head indeed, but never to hide himself from himself.  How long he sat there he knew not.  When he rose he was at least calm and resolved.  He went up to his own room and looked through his little stock of possessions.  The old suit in which he had come to Wildtree was there; and an impulse seized him to put it on in exchange for the trim garments he was wearing.  Of his other goods and chattels he took a few special favourites.  His Homer--Julius's collar--a cricket cap--a pocket compass which Percy had given him, and an envelope which Raby had once directed to him for her uncle.  His money--his last quarter's salary--he took too, and his old stick which he had cut in the lanes near Ash Cottage. That was all.  Then quietly descending the deserted stairs, and looking neither to the right hand nor the left, he crossed the hall and opened the front door.  A pang shot through him as he did so.  Was he never to see Percy again, or _her_?  What would they think of him?  The thought maddened him; and as he stood in the street he seemed to hear their voices, too, in the awful clamour, and rushed blindly forth, anywhere, to escape it.    CHAPTER TWENTY THREE.  A PLUNGE DOWNWARD.  A chill October squall was whistling through the trees--in Regent's Park, stirring up the fallen leaves on the footpaths, and making the nursemaids, as they listlessly trundled their perambulators, shiver suddenly, and think of the nursery fire and the singing kettle on the hob.  The gathering clouds above sent the park-keeper off to his shed for a waterproof, and emptied the carriage-drive of the vehicles in which a few semi-grand people were taking an afternoon airing at half a crown an hour.  A little knot of small boys, intently playing football, with piled-up jackets for goals, and an old parti-coloured ""bouncer"" for a ball, were the last to take alarm at the lowering sky; nor was it till the big drops fell in their midst that they scattered right and left, and left the park empty.  No; not quite empty.  One young man sat on through the rain on the seat from which he had been watching the boys' game.  A shabby, almost ragged young man, with a disagreeable face and an almost contemptuous curl of the lips, as the rain, gathering force every second, buffeted him in the face and drenched him where he sat.  There were a hundred seats more sheltered than that on which he sat, and by walking scarcely fifty yards he could have escaped the rain altogether.  But he sat recklessly on, and let the rain do its worst, his eyes still on the empty football field, and his ears ringing still with the merry shouts of the departed boys.  My reader, had he chanced to pass down that deserted walk on this stormy afternoon, would hardly have recognised in the lonely occupant of that seat the John Jeffreys he had seen six months ago at Clarges Street.  It was not merely that he looked haggard and ill, or that his clothes were ragged.  That was bad enough, but the reader has seen him in such a plight before.  But what he has not seen before--or if at all, only in passing moments--is the bitter, hard look on his face, changing it miserably.  A stranger passing him that afternoon would have said--  ""There sits a man who hates all the world.""  We, who know him better, would have said--  ""There sits our poor dog with a bad name, deserted even by hope.""  And so it was.  Jeffreys had left Clarges Street smarting under a sense of injury, but still resolved to keep up the fight for his good name, in which for so many months past he had been engaged.  Not by appealing to Mr Rimbolt.  Although he knew, had Mr Rimbolt been at home, all this would not have happened, his pride forbade him now to take a single step to reinstate himself in a house from which he had been so ignominiously expelled.  No, not even when that house held within its walls Percy and Raby.  The idea of going back filled him with horror.  On the contrary, he would hide himself from them, even though they sought to find him; and not till his name was as good as theirs would he see them again or come near them.  Which surely was another way of resolving never to see them again; for the leopard cannot change his spots or the Ethiopian his skin!  A bad name is a stain which no washing can efface; it clings wherever you go, and often men who see it see nothing else in you but the scar.  So thought poor Jeffreys as he slowly turned his back on all that was dear to him in life, and went out into the night of the unsympathetic city.  At first, as I said, he tried to hold up his head.  He inquired in one or two quarters for work.  But the question always came up--  ""What is your character?""  ""I have none,"" he would say doggedly.  ""Why did you leave your last place?""  ""I was turned away.""  ""What for?""  ""Because I am supposed to have killed a boy once.""  Once indeed he did get a temporary job at a warehouse--as a porter--and for a week, a happy week, used his broad back and brawny arms in carrying heavy loads and lifting weights.  Hope sprang again within him as he laboured.  He might yet, by beginning at the lowest step, rise above his evil name and conquer it.  Alas!  One day a shilling was lost from the warehouseman's desk. Jeffreys had been seen near the place and was suspected.  He resented the charge scornfully at first, then savagely, and in an outbreak of rage struck his accuser.  He was impeached before the head of the firm, and it was discovered that he had come without a character.  That was enough.  He was bundled out of the place at five minutes' notice, with a threat of a policeman if he made it six.  And even when a week later the shilling was found in the warehouseman's blotting-paper, no one doubted that the cashiered rogue was as cunning as he was nefarious.  After that he had given up what seemed the farce of holding up his head. What was the use, he said, when, as sure as night follows day, that bad name of his dogged him wherever he went?  So Jeffreys began to go down.  In after years he spoke very little of those six months in London, and when he did it was about people he had met, and not about himself.  What he did, where he lodged, how he lived, these were matters he never mentioned and never liked to be asked about.  I am quite sure myself that the reason of this silence was not shame. He was not one of those fellows who revenge themselves on fate by deliberately going to the bad.  At his worst, he had no taste for vice or any affinity for it.  He may have sunk low, not because he himself was low, but because in his miserable feud with all the world he scorned not to share the lot of others as miserable as himself.  His money--he had a few pounds when he left Clarges Street--soon failed him.  He made no great effort to keep it, and was relieved to see the end of it.  His companions in misery soon helped him away with it, and he let them.  But when it was gone the old necessity for work came back.  By day he hardly ever ventured out of his court, for fear of being seen by some one who would attempt to rescue him from his present condition.  At night he wandered restlessly about in the narrow streets picking up an early morning job at Covent Garden or in the omnibus stables.  He moved his lodgings incessantly, one week inhabiting a garret in Westminster, another sharing a common room in Whitechapel, another doing without lodgings altogether.  He spoke little or not at all to his fellow-miserables, not because he despised them, but because they fought shy of him.  They disliked his superior ways and his ill-concealed disgust of their habits and vices.  They could have forgiven him for being a criminal in hiding; that they were used to.  But a man who spoke like a gentleman, who took no pleasure in their low sports, and sat dumb while they talked loud and broad, seemed to them an interloper and an intruder.  Once--it was about the beginning of August--in a lodging-house across the river, he met a man to whom for a day or two he felt drawn.  His story was a sad one.  His father had been a gentleman, and the boy had been brought up in luxury and virtue.  While at school his father had died, and before he had left school his mother had been married again to a brute who not only broke her heart, but, after setting himself to corrupt his stepson, had at last turned him adrift without a penny in the world.  The lad, with no strong principle to uphold him, had sunk deep in vice.  Yet there lurked about him occasional flashes of something better.  ""After all,"" he would say to Jeffreys, as the two lay at night almost on bare boards, ""what's the odds?  I may be miserable one day, but I'm jolly the next.  Now you seem to prefer to be uniformly miserable.""  ""Hardly a case of preference,"" said Jeffreys; ""but I'm not sure that it wouldn't be more miserable to be jolly.""  ""Try it.  You'd give a lot to forget all about everything for an hour, wouldn't you?""  ""It would be pleasant.""  ""You can do it.""  ""By dropping asleep?""  ""Sleep!  That's the time I'm most miserable.  I remember the old days then, and my mother, and--I say, Jeffreys, I was once nearly drowned at Eton.  Just as I was going down for the last time I put up my hand, and a fellow saw it and came in and fished me out.  What a born fool I was to do it!  I was grateful to the fellow at the time.  I hate him now!""  And the poor fellow, with all the manhood out of him, cried himself to sleep; and Jeffreys in mercy said not a word to stop him.  A pitiful sort of friendship sprung up between the two--the bitter strong one, and the vicious weak one.  It kept a soft corner in Jeffreys' heart to find some one who held to him even in this degradation, and to the poor prodigal it was worth anything to have some one to talk to.  Coming home one wet morning from one of his nocturnal expeditions, Jeffreys found his fellow-lodger up, with a bottle in his hands.  ""My boy, my boy,"" cried the lad, ""you're in luck, and just in time.  Who says I'm lost to all decency after this?  Why, I might have hidden it away when I heard you coming up.  No.  There's something of the nobleman left in me yet.  Half of this is yours, Jeffreys; only help yourself quickly, man, or I may repent.""  He held out the bottle tremblingly and with a wince that spoke volumes.  ""Take it.  I never went halves before, and perhaps I never shall again.""  Jeffreys took the bottle.  It was brandy.  ""Half a tumbler of that, Jeffreys, will make another man of you.  It will send you into dreamland.  You'll forget there is such a thing as misery in the world.  Don't be squeamish, old fellow.  You're cold and weak, you know you are; you ought to take it.  You're not too good, surely--eh?  Man alive, if you never do anything worse than take a drop of brandy, you'll pass muster.  Come, I say, you're keeping me waiting.""  Jeffreys sunk on a chair, and raised the bottle half-way to his lips.  What was it, as he did so, which flashed before his eyes and caused him suddenly to set it down and rise to his feet?  Nothing real, it is true, yet nothing new.  Just a momentary glimpse of a boy's pale face somewhere in the dim gloom of that little room, and then all was as before.  Yet to Jeffreys the whole world was suddenly altered.  He set the bottle down, and neither heeding nor hearing the expostulations of his companion, he left the house never to return.  That night he slept in another part of the town; and the poor bewildered prodigal, deserted by his only friend, cried half the night through, and cursed again the Eton boy who had once saved his life.  Jeffreys, hidden in another part of the great city, sunk to a lower depth of misery than ever.  To him it seemed now that his bad name had taken form in the face of young Forrester, and was dogging him in adversity more relentlessly even than in prosperity.  It comforted him not at all to think it had saved him from a drunkard's ruin.  He despised himself, when he came to himself, for having been scared so weakly.  Yet he avoided his old quarters, and turned his back on the one friend he had, rather than face his evil genius again.  His evil genius!  Was he blinded then, that he saw in all this nothing but evil and despair?  Was he so numbed that he could not feel a Father's hand leading him even through the mist?  Had he forgotten that two little boys far away were praying for him?  Had he ceased to feel that young Forrester himself might be somewhere, not far away, ready to forgive?  He was blinded, and could see nothing through the mists.  He half envied his new fellow-lodgers in the den at Ratcliff.  Four of them, at least, stood a chance of being hanged.  Yet they managed to shake off care and live merrily.  ""Come, old gallus,"" said one young fellow, who in that place was the hero of a recent ""mystery"" in the West End, ""perk up.  You're safe enough here.  Don't be down.  We're all in the same boat.  Save up them long faces for eight o'clock in the morning at Old Bailey.  Don't spoil our fun.""  It was half pathetic, this appeal; and Jeffreys for a day tried to be cheerful.  But he could not do it, and considerately went somewhere else.  How long was it to go on?  A time came when he could get no work, and starvation stared him in the face.  But a dying boy bequeathed him a loaf, and once again he was doomed to live.  But a loaf, and the proceeds of a week's odd jobs, came to an end.  And now once more, as he sits in the rain in Regent's Park, he faces something more than the weather.  He has not tasted food for two whole days, and for all he knows may never taste it again.  So he sits there, with his eyes still on that football ground, and his ears ringing still with the merry shouts of the departed boys.  The scene changes as he stays on.  It is a football field still, but not the brown patch in a London park.  There are high trees, throwing shadows across the green turf, and in the distance an old red school- house.  And the boys are no longer the lively London urchins with their red, white, and blue bouncer.  They are in flannels, and their faces are familiar, and the names they call each other he knows.  Nor is the game the same.  It, like the London boys' game, has ended suddenly, but not in a helter-skelter stampede in the rain.  No.  It is a silent, awe- struck group round something on the ground; and as he, Jeffreys, elbows his way among them, he sees again a boy's face lying there pallid and perhaps lifeless.  Then instinctively he lifts his hands to his ears. For a howl rises on all sides which deafens him, stuns him.  After all, it is only the last effort of the October squall in Regent's Park buffeting him with a fusillade of rain and withered leaves.  He takes his hands from his ears, and with a sigh gets up and walks away, he cares not whither.  His steps lead him round the park and into the long avenue.  The rain and the wind are dying down, and already a few wayfarers, surprised by the sudden storm, are emerging from their shelters and speeding home. The park-keeper boldly parades the path in his waterproof, as if he had braved the elements since daybreak.  A nursemaid draws out her perambulator from under the trees and hastens with it and its wailing occupant nursery-wards.  And there, coming to meet him, sheltered under one umbrella, are two who perhaps have no grudge against the storm for detaining them in their walk that afternoon.  It is long since Jeffreys has seen anything to remind him of the world he has left, but there is something about these two as they advance towards him, their faces hidden by the umbrella, which attracts him. The youth is slim and well-dressed, and holds himself well; his companion's figure reminds him of a form he knew--can it be only six months ago?--light, gentle, courageous, beside which he has walked in the Wildtree Park and on the London pavements.  Ah, how changed now!  Where, he wonders, is _she_ now? and what is she thinking of him, if she thinks of him at all?  They meet--the tramp and the young couple.  They never heed him; how should they?  But a turn of the umbrella gives him a momentary glimpse of them, and in that glimpse poor hapless Jeffreys recognises Raby and Scarfe!  Surely this blow was not needed to crush him completely! Scarfe!  How long he stood, statue-like, looking down the path by which they had gone neither he nor any one else could tell.  But it was dark when he was roused by a harsh voice in front of him.  ""Come, sheer off, young fellow!  It's time you was out of the park!""  ""Yes, I'll go,"" said he, and walked slowly to the gate.  It was ridiculous of him, of course, to writhe as he did under that chance meeting.  What else could he have expected?  A hundred times already he had told himself she had forgotten all about him, or, worse still, she remembered him only to despise him.  And a hundred times, too, he had seen her in fancy beside the enemy who had stabbed him.  For Scarfe might have spared his precaution in begging Mrs Rimbolt not to name him as Jeffreys' accuser.  Jeffreys needed no telling to whom he owed his ruin, and he needed no telling the reason why.  That reason had made itself clear this afternoon, at any rate, and as the wretched outcast wandered out into the night, it seemed as if the one ray of light which yesterday had glimmered for him, even across the darkness, was now quenched for ever, and that there was nothing left either to hope or dread.  He could not quit the park, but wandered round and round it, outside its inhospitable palings, covering mile after mile of wet pavement, heedless of the now drenching rain, heedless of his hunger, heedless of his failing limbs.  The noisy streets had grown silent, and a clock near at hand had struck two when he found himself on the little bridge which crosses the canal. It was too dark to see the water below, but he heard the hard rain hissing on its surface.  He had stood there before, in happier days, and wondered how men and women could choose, as they sometimes did, to end their misery in that narrow streak of sluggish water.  He wondered less now.  Not that he felt tempted to follow them; in his lowest depths of misery that door of escape had never allured him.  Yet as he stood he felt fascinated, and even soothed, by the ceaseless noise of the rain on the invisible water beneath.  It seemed almost like the voice of a friend far away.  He had been listening for some time, crouched in a dark corner of the parapet, when he became aware of footsteps approaching.  Imagining at first they were those of a policeman coming to dislodge the tramp from his lurking-place, he prepared to get up and move on.  But listening again he remained where he was.  The footsteps were not those of a policeman.  They approached fitfully, now quickly, now slowly, now stopping still for a moment or two, yet they were too agitated for those of a drunkard, and too uncertain for those of a fugitive from justice.  As they drew near to the bridge they stopped once more, and Jeffreys, peering through the darkness, saw a form clutching the railings, and looking down in the direction of the water.  Then a voice groaned, ""Oh my God!"" and the footsteps hurried on.  Jeffreys had seen misery in many forms go past him before, but something impelled him now to rise and follow the footsteps of this wanderer.  The plashing rain drowned every sound, and it was with difficulty that Jeffreys, weak and weary as he was, could keep pace with the figure flitting before him, for after that glance over the bridge the fugitive no longer halted in his pace, but went on rapidly.  Across the bridge he turned and followed the high banks of the canal. Then he halted, apparently looking for a way down.  It was a long impatient search, but at last Jeffreys saw him descend along some railings which sloped down the steep grass slope almost to the towing- path.  Jeffreys followed with difficulty, and when at last he stood on the towing-path the fugitive was not to be seen, nor was it possible to say whether he had turned right or left.  Jeffreys turned to the right, and anxiously scanning both the bank and the water, tramped along the muddy path.  A few yards down he came upon a heap of stones piled up across the path. Any one clambering across this must have made noise enough to be heard twenty yards away, and, as far as he could judge in the darkness, no one had stepped upon it.  He therefore turned back hurriedly and retraced his steps.  The sullen water, hissing still under the heavy rain, gave no sign as he ran along its edge and scanned it with anxious eyes.  The high bank on his left, beyond the palings, became inaccessible from below.  The wanderer must, therefore, be before him on the path.  For five minutes he ran on, straining his eyes and ears, when suddenly he stumbled.  It was a hat upon the path.  In a moment Jeffreys dived into the cold water.  As he came to the surface and looked round there was nothing but the spreading circles of his own plunge to be seen; but a moment afterwards, close to the bank, he had a glimpse of something black rising for an instant and then disappearing.  Three strokes brought him to the spot just as the object rose again.  To seize it and strike out for the bank was the work of a moment.  The man--for it was he--was alive, and as Jeffreys slowly drew him from the water he opened his eyes and made a faint resistance.  ""Let me go!"" he said with an oath; ""let me go!""  But his head fell heavily on his rescuer's shoulder while he spoke, and when at last he lay on the path he was senseless.  Jeffreys carried him to the shelter of an arch, and there did what he could to restore animation.  It was too dark to see the man's face, but he could feel his pulse still beating, and presently he gave a sigh and moved his head.  ""What did you do it for?"" he said piteously.  Jeffreys started.  He knew the voice, hoarse and choked as it was.  ""What's your name?"" he said, raising the form in his arms and trying to see the face.  ""Who are you?""  ""I've got no name!  Why couldn't you let me be?""  ""Isn't your name Trimble--Jonah Trimble?""  The poor fellow lifted his head with a little shriek.  ""Oh, don't give me up!  Don't have me taken up!  Help me!""  ""I will help you all I can, Trimble.""  ""Why, you know me, then?--you're--Who are you?""  ""I'm John Jeffreys.""    CHAPTER TWENTY FOUR.  AN ANGEL UNAWARES.  In a wretched garret of a house in Storr Alley, near Euston, at the sick-bed of his old enemy, Jeffreys reached a turning-point in his life. How he conveyed the half-drowned Jonah on the night of the rescue from the canal bank to his lodgings he scarcely knew.  The hand of a friend is often near when it is least expected.  So Jonah had found, when he believed all hope and life to be gone; and so Jeffreys had found, when, with his poor burden in his arms, he met, beside a barge at daybreak, a dealer in vegetables for whom he had sometimes worked at Covent Garden, and who now, like a Good Samaritan, not only gave the two a lift in his cart, but provided Jeffreys with an opportunity of earning a shilling on the way.  This shilling worked marvels.  For both Trimble and Jeffreys were on the verge of starvation; and without food that night rescue would have been but a farce.  It was soon evident that Jonah had far more the matter with him than the mere effects of his immersion.  He was a wreck, body and soul.  The dispensary doctor who called to see him gave him a fortnight to live, and the one or two brave souls who penetrated, on errands of mercy, even into Storr Alley, marked his hollow cough and sunken cheeks, and knew that before long one name more would drop out of their lists.  It was slowly, and in fragments only, that Jeffreys heard his story. Jonah was for ever reproaching him with what had happened on the canal bank.  ""Why couldn't you have left a fellow alone?  I know, you wanted to gloat over me.  Go on, be as happy as you like.  Enjoy your revenge.  I did you a bad turn; now you've done me one, so we're quits!""  Here a fit of coughing would shake the breath out of the sufferer, and it would be a minute or two before he could proceed.  Jeffreys wisely avoided all expostulations or self-excuse.  He smoothed the poor fellow's pillow, and supported him in his arms till the cough was over and he could proceed.  ""It was a bad day you ever came to our school, John""--Jonah had adopted the name by which Jeffreys was known in Storr Alley--""I hated you the first time I saw you.  You've got the laugh on your side now; but I can tell you you wouldn't have had it then if you knew the way I followed you up.  Yes""--and here came a shadow of his own sinister smile--""I made it all fit in like a puzzle.  Did you never miss a letter you had that day you called at the York post- office--a letter about the dead burying their dead, and young Forrester? oh yes, you may start; I know all about it.  I took that letter out of your pocket.  And I know where you buried his body; do you suppose I didn't see you throw yourself on the very place and say, `It was here'? You held your nose in the air, didn't you, in the school, and palmed yourself off on Freddy and Teddy for a model?  But I bowled you out.  I showed you up.  That was the day of my laugh.  Now you've got yours.""  The cough again stopped him; and when he recovered his breath Jeffreys said quietly--  ""Don't talk, Jonah; you bring on your cough.  Let me read to you.""  Then for the remainder of that day the story would rest; till later on Jonah would abruptly return to it.  ""Mother believed in you, and cried a whole day after you had gone.  Yes, and you'll be glad to hear the school broke up all to pieces.  Farmer Rosher took away his boys and spread a report about us; and at the end of a month we had scarcely a dozen urchins.  Mother and I lived like cat and dog.  I struck work, and she had to do everything, and it broke her up.  It would never have happened if you hadn't come into the place.  I couldn't live there any longer.  Mother had a little bit saved, fifty pounds or so, and one night, after we had had a terrible row, I took every penny of it out of her money-box and came up to London.  Now are you pleased?  Hadn't she something to bless you for?  I say, John, get us some water quick, I'm parched!""  On another day Jeffreys heard the rest.  ""I came up to London, but it wasn't the fun I expected.  Everybody I met I thought was a detective, and all night long I dreamed of my mother.  I tried to drown it, and lived as wild a life as you like till my money was done.  Then it would have been worth your while to see me. Everybody was against me.  Fellows I'd stood treat to kicked me out into the street, and fellows who owed me money laughed in my face.  I thought I'd go back to York after all and get mother to take me back; but when I came to start I couldn't face it.  That's all.  I stood it as long as I could.  I pawned everything, and when that was done I stole--and got three months on the treadmill.  How do you like that?  When I got out, a city missionary heard of me and found me a job; but I stole again, and ran away.  You wouldn't have thought I had it in me at York, would you? I was a respectable young fellow there.  But it was all there; and it was you brought it all out.  Last week I made up my mind to put an end to it all.  It took me a struggle to face it; but I was settled to do it--and then, as if you hadn't done enough harm, you come and spoil my last chance.""  ""Not your last chance, Jonah.""  ""No.  I've a week more to live.  Then you'll be rid of me.  Who's to save me then?""  ""Some one, Jonah.  We have both forgotten Him, but He's not forgotten us.""  ""Oh yes, I know,"" said Jonah; ""but it's all very well for you, who've got years to get right in.  It's too short notice for me to begin all that over again.  I don't want to hear about it.""  He lingered on day after day, and it was absolutely necessary for Jeffreys to go and seek work in order to keep even that wretched roof above their heads.  One evening when he returned with a few coppers, Jonah met him with a face brighter than any that he had yet seen.  ""I've had some one here to-day.  A better sort than you.  One that's got a right to talk about what's better.  A lady, John, or else an angel. Did _you_ send her?""  ""I?  No; I know no ladies.""  ""I don't know how it was, I could tell her anything--and, I say, John, it would make you cry to hear her voice.  It did me.  _You_ never made me cry, or saw me; I hate to hear _you_ preach; but she--why, she doesn't preach at all, but she says all you've got to say a hundred times better.""  He was excited and feverish that night, and in his sleep murmured scraps of the gentle talk of his ministering angel, which even from his lips fell with a reflected sweetness on the trouble-tossed spirit of the watcher.  Jeffreys had succeeded in getting a temporary job which took him away during the next two days.  But each night on his return he found his invalid brighter and softened in spirit by reason of his angel's visits.  ""She'll come to-morrow, John.  There's magic in her, I tell you.  I see things I never saw before.  You've been kind to me, John, and given up a lot for me, but if you were to hear her--""  Here the dying youth could get no farther.  He seemed much the same in the morning when Jeffreys started for work. The last words he said as his friend departed were--  ""She's coming again to-day.""  When Jeffreys came home in the evening the garret was silent, and on the bed lay all that remained on earth of the poor wrecked life which had been so strangely linked with his own.  As he stood over the lifeless body his eyes fell on a scrap of paper lying on the pillow.  It was folded and addressed in pencil, ""To the fellow-lodger.""  Jeffreys caught it eagerly, and in a turmoil of agitation read the few lines within.  ""Your friend was not alone when he died, peacefully, this afternoon.  He left a message for you.  `Tell him he was right when he told me I had a chance.  If it had not been for him I should have lost it.'  He also said, `Some day he may see mother and tell her about me.  Tell her I died better than I lived.'  Dear friend, whose name I do not know, don't lose heart.  God is merciful, and will be your friend when every one else is taken from you.""  It was not the words of this touching little message from the dead which brought a gasp to Jeffreys' throat and sent the colour from his cheeks as he read it.  The writing, hasty and agitated as it was, was a hand he had seen before.  He had in his pocket an envelope, well-worn now, addressed to him months ago in the same writing, and as he held the two side by side he knew Raby had written both.  He quitted the garret hurriedly, and entered the room of a family of five who lived below him.  ""Mrs Pratt,"" said he to the ragged woman who sat nursing her baby in the corner, ""did you see who Trimble had with him when he died?""  ""He's dead, then, sir""--these fellow-lodgers of Jeffreys called him ""sir"" in spite of his misery.  ""I knew that cough couldn't last.  My Annie's begun with it: she'll go too.  It's been hard enough to keep the children, but it will be harder to lose them!"" she cried.  Jeffreys went to the bed where the little consumptive girl lay in a restless sleep, breathing heavily.  ""Poor little Annie!"" said he; ""I did not know she was so ill.""  ""How could you?  Yes, I saw the lady come down--a pretty wee thing.  She comes and goes here.  Maybe when she hears of Annie she'll come to her.""  ""Do you know her name?""  ""No.  She's a lady, they say.  I heard her singing upstairs to Trimble; it was a treat!  So Trimble's dead.  You'll be glad of some help, I expect?  If you'll mind the children, Mr John, I'll go up and do the best we can for the poor fellow.""  And so Jeffreys, with the baby in his arms, sat beside the little invalid in that lonely room, while the mother, putting aside her own sorrows, went up and did a woman's service where it was most needed. Next day he had the garret to himself.  That letter--how he treasured it!--changed life for him.  He had expected, when Jonah's illness ended, to drift back once more into the bitterness of despair.  But that was impossible now.  He made no attempt to see the angel of whose visits to the alley he now and again heard.  Indeed, whether he was in work or not, he left early and came back late on purpose to avoid a meeting.  He had long been known by his neighbours only as John, so that there was no chance of her discovering who he was.  Sometimes the memory of that October day in Regent's Park came up to haunt him and poison even the comfort of the little letter.  Yet why should she not have forgotten him? and why should not Scarfe, the man with a character, be more to her than he, the man with none?  Yet he tried bravely to banish all, save the one thought that it _was_ she who bade him hope and take courage.  He worked well and patiently at the temporary manual labour on which he was employed, and when that came to an end he looked about resolutely for more.  Meanwhile--do not smile, reader--he made an investment of capital!  In other words, he spent threepence in pen, ink, paper, and a candle, and spent one night in his lonely garret writing.  It was a letter, addressed to a stranger, on a public question.  In other words, it was an article to a London paper on, ""Life in a Slum, by One who Lives There.""  It was a quiet, unsensational paper, with some practical suggestions for the improvement of poor people's dwellings, and a few true stories of experiences in which the writer himself had taken a part.  He dropped it doubtfully into the editor's box and tried to forget about it.  He dared not look at the paper next day, and when two days passed and he heard nothing, he concluded that the bolt had missed fire.  But it was not so.  A week later, the postman entered Storr Alley--an unheard-of event--and left a letter.  It contained a money order for ten shillings, and read:--  ""The editor encloses ten shillings for the letter on Slum Life, contributed by Mr John to the paper of the 23rd.  He can take two more on the same subject at the same terms, and suggests that Mr John should deal specially with--"" And here the editor gave an outline of the topics on which the public would be most likely to desire information.  With overflowing heart, and giving Raby the credit, he sat down and wrote the two articles.  His first half-sovereign went in a deed of mercy.  Little Annie lay dead in her bed the night it arrived.  Jeffreys that morning, before he started to work, had watched the little spark of life flicker for the last time and go out.  The mother, worn-out by her constant vigils, lay ill beside her dead child.  The father, a drunkard, out of work, deserted the place, and the two other children, the baby, and the sister scarcely more than baby, wailed all day for cold and hunger.  What could he do but devote the first-fruits of his pen to these companions in distress?  The half-sovereign sufficed for the child's funeral, with a little over for the sick mother.  For the rest, he took the baby to his own garret for a night or two, and tended it there as best he could.  The two fresh letters to the paper in due time brought a sovereign; but at the same time a chilling notification to the effect that the editor did not need further contributions, and would let Mr John know if at any future time he required his services.  It was the abrupt closing of one door of promise.  Still Jeffreys, with hope big within him, did not sit and fret.  Literary work might yet be had, and meanwhile bodily labour must be endured.  Towards the beginning of December, any one taking up one of the London penny papers might have observed, had he been given to the study of such matters, three advertisements.  Here they are in their proper order:--  ""Should this meet the eye of John Jeffreys, late private secretary to a gentleman in Cumberland, he is earnestly requested to communicate with his friend and late employer.""  Readers of the agony column were getting tired of this advertisement. It had appeared once a week for the last six months, and was getting stale by this time.  The next advertisement was more recent, but still a trifle dull:--  ""Gerard Forrester.  ""If Gerard Forrester (son of the late Captain Forrester, of the-- Hussars) who was last heard of at Bolsover School, in October, 18--, where he met with a serious accident, should see this, he is requested to communicate with Messrs. Wilkins & Wilkins, Solicitors, Blank Street, W.C., from whom he will hear something to his advantage.  Any person able to give satisfactory information leading to the discovery of the said Gerard Forrester, or, in the event of his death, producing evidence of his decease, will be liberally rewarded.""  The third advertisement, in another column, appeared now for the first time:--  ""A young man, well educated, and a careful student of Bibliography, is anxious for literary work.  Searches made and extracts copied.--Apply, J., 28a, Storr Alley, W.C.""  It would have puzzled any ordinary observer to detect in these three appeals anything to connect them together.  Jeffreys, however, glancing down the columns of the borrowed paper for a sight of his own advertisement, started and turned pale as his eye fell first on his own name, then on Forrester's.  It was like a conspiracy to bewilder and baffle him at the moment when hope seemed to be returning.  He had convinced himself that his one chance was to break with every tie which bound him to his old life, and to start afresh from the lowest step of all.  And here, at the outset, there met him two calls from that old life, both of which it was hard to resist.  Mr Rimbolt, he decided to resist at all hazards.  He still shuddered as he recalled the stiff rustle of a certain silk dress in Clarges Street, and preferred his present privations a hundredfold. Even the thought of Percy, and the library, and Mr Rimbolt's goodness, could not efface that one overpowering impression.  The other advertisement perplexed and agitated him more.  Who was this unknown person on whose behalf Messrs. Wilkins & Wilkins were seeking information respecting young Forrester?  It might be Scarfe, or Mr Frampton, or possibly some unheard-of relative, interested in the disposal of the late gallant officer's effects.  He could not assist the search.  The little he knew was probably already known to the lawyers, yet it excited him wildly to think that some one besides himself was in search of the lad whose memory had haunted him for so many months, and whom, even in his most despairing moments, he had never quite given up for lost.  True, he had long since ceased to believe that he was really to be found by searching.  Everything combined to baffle search, almost to forbid it, and yet he had constantly lived in a vague expectation of finding or hearing of him some day accidentally and unawares.  But this advertisement filled him with self-reproach.  What right had he to do anything, to rest a day, till he had found this lost boy--lost by his fault, by his sin?  No wonder he had not prospered.  No wonder the bad name had haunted him and dragged him down!  One thing was certain-- whether what he knew was known to others or not, it was his duty to aid now in this new search.  So he wrote as follows to Messrs. Wilkins & Wilkins:--  ""_Private and Confidential_.  ""The writer of this knew Gerard Forrester at Bolsover School two years ago, and was responsible almost wholly for the accident referred to. The writer left Bolsover in consequence, and has not seen Forrester since.  In May of the following year he made inquiries at Grangerham, Forrester's native place, where he ascertained that the boy had been removed there from Bolsover and had remained for some time with his grandmother, Mrs Wilcox.  Mrs Wilcox, however, was ordered to the South for her health, and died at Torquay.  Forrester, who appears to have been a cripple, and unable to help himself, was then left in charge of his old nurse, who left Grangerham shortly afterwards, it is said, in order to take the boy to a hospital--where, no one could say.  That is the last the writer heard.  Messrs. W. & W. might do well to apply to the clergyman and Wesleyan minister at Grangerham, who may have some later news.  The writer would be thankful to be of any service in helping to find one whom he has so terribly wronged; and any letter addressed `J., at Jones's Coffee-House, Drury Lane,' will find him.  ""It should be said that when Forrester was last seen, only faint hopes were held out as to his recovery, even as a cripple.""  An anxious time followed.  It was hard to work as usual--harder still to wait.  The idea of Forrester being after all found took strange possession of his mind, to the exclusion of all else.  The prospect which had seemed to open before him appeared suddenly blocked; he could think of nothing ahead except that one possible meeting.  So preoccupied was he, that his own advertisement for work was forgotten the day after it appeared; and when two days later he found a letter pushed under the door, his heart leaped to his mouth with the conviction that it could refer to nothing but the one object before him.  It did not; it was a reply to his advertisement.  ""J-- is requested to call to-morrow, at 10 a.m., on Mr Trotter, 6, Porson Square, in reference to his advertisement for literary work.""  With some trepidation, and no particular expectations, Jeffreys presented himself at the appointed time, and found himself face to face with a testy little gentleman, with by no means large pretensions to literary authority.  He took in the shabby-looking advertiser at a glance, and suited his tone accordingly.  ""So you're the chap, are you?  You're the nice educated literary chap that wants a job, eh?""  ""I am.""  ""What can you do?  Write poetry?""  ""I never tried.""  ""Write 'istory, or 'igh hart, and that sort of thing?""  ""I have not tried.  I know mostly about bibliography.""  ""Bibli--who?  You'll turn your 'and to anything for a crust, I suppose. Do you ever do anything in the puff line?""  Jeffreys admitted he had not.  ""'Cos I want a chap to crack up my `Polyglot Pickle' in proper literary style.  None of your commonplace maunderings, but something smart and startling.  What do you say?  Can you do it or not?""  Jeffreys heart sank low.  ""I'll try--""  ""Can you do it?"" demanded the proud inventor.  ""Yes,"" said Jeffreys desperately.  ""All right,"" said Mr Trotter, greatly relieved.  ""I want a book of twenty pages.  Write anything you like, only bring the pickles in on each page.  You know the style.  Twenty blood-curdling ballads, or Aesop's fables, or something the public's bound to read.  Something racy, mind, and all ending in the pickle.  It's a good thing, so you needn't be afraid of overdoing it.  You shall have a bob a page, money down, or twenty-five bob for the lot if you let me have it this time to- morrow.  Remember, nothing meek and mild.  Lay it on thick.  They're the best thing going, and got a good name.  Polyglot, that's many tongues; everybody tastes 'em.""  Jeffreys, with a dismal sense of the humour of the situation, accepted his noble task meekly, and sat down in Mr Trotter's back room with a bottle of the pickles on the table before him.  The reader shall be spared the rubbish he wrote.  To this day he flares up angrily if you so much as mention the Polyglot Pickle to him.  The public, who laughed next week over the ridiculous bathos of those twenty loud-sounding ballads, little guessed the misery and disgust they had cost their author.  The one part of the whole business that was not odious was that in six hours Jeffreys had twenty-five shillings in his pocket; and to him twenty-five shillings meant a clear week and more in which to devote himself to the now all-absorbing task of seeking young Forrester.  On his way back to Storr Alley that evening he called as usual at the coffee-house, and found a further letter awaiting him:--  ""Messrs. Wilkins & Wilkins will be much obliged if the writer of the letter of the sixth inst. will favour them with a call on Wednesday forenoon, as he may be able to assist them materially in the search in which they are engaged.  Messrs. W. & W. will treat an interview as confidential.""    CHAPTER TWENTY FIVE.  HIGH DUDGEON.  Things had not been going well with Percy Rimbolt since we saw him last, six or eight months ago, just before Jeffreys' expulsion from the house in Clarges Street.  Mrs Rimbolt had some reason to modify her self- congratulations on that occasion, when Percy and Raby, who, it will be remembered, had been out riding at the time, returned home.  Percy returned in high spirits; his new horse had turned out a beauty, and the canter in the park had acted like a tonic.  ""Hullo, mother!"" he said, as his parent came into the hall to meet him. ""We've had a grand time, Raby and I.  We saw the Prince of Wales and W.G.  Grace, and the Queen, and everybody, and I gave Raby two hundred yards from the corner and ran her down before we were off Knightsbridge, and nearly got hauled up for furious riding.  I say, I mean to make father get a horse for old Jeff, and we'll go out early in the mornings, when the Row's empty, and try handicaps, eh, Raby?  Where's Jeff, I say?"" and he ran whistling upstairs.  His mother, with some premonitory misgivings followed him.  ""Where are you, Jeff?"" she heard him shout.  ""I say, mother,"" he added, as Mrs Rimbolt approached, ""where's Jeff?  Is he out?""  ""He is,"" said Mrs Rimbolt solemnly.  ""I want to speak to you, Percy.""  ""All right.  But I say, when will he be in?  He said he couldn't leave his work this afternoon.  I want him to see Bendigo before he goes round to the stables.""  ""You had better tell the groom he need not wait, and then please come to my room, Percy,"" said Mrs Rimbolt.  Percy shouted down to Walker to send away the horse, and followed his mother into her boudoir.  ""Percy, my dear boy,"" began the lady, ""I am sorry to say I have just had to perform a very unpleasant duty.  You can hardly understand--""  ""What about--anything about Jeff?"" interrupted the boy, jumping at the truth.  ""It is.  It has been necessary, for everybody's sake, that he should leave here.""  ""What!"" thundered Percy, turning pale and clutching the back of his chair; ""you've sent Jeff away--kicked him out?""  ""Come, Percy, don't be unreasonable.  I--""  ""When did he go--how long ago?"" exclaimed the boy, half frantic.  ""Percy, you really--""  ""How long ago?""  ""It is more than an hour since--""  Percy waited to hear no more; he dashed down the stairs and shouted to Walker.  ""Did you see Jeffreys go?  Which way did he go?""  ""I didn't see--""  ""Come and help me look for him, he's sure to be about.  Tell Appleby, do you hear?  Raby, I say,"" he exclaimed, as his cousin appeared in the hall, ""Jeff's been kicked out an hour ago!  I'm going to find him!"" and the poor lad, with a heart almost bursting, flung open the door and rushed out into the street.  Alas! it was a fool's errand, and he knew it.  Still, he could not endure to do nothing.  After two weary hours he gave it up, and returned home dispirited and furious.  Walker and Appleby had taken much less time to appreciate the uselessness of the search, and had returned an hour ago from a perfunctory walk round one or two neighbouring streets.  Our young Achilles, terrible in his wrath, would see no one, not even his mother, not even Raby.  Once or twice that evening they heard the front door slam, and knew he once more was on the look-out.  Mrs Rimbolt, alarmed at the storm which she had raised, already repented of her haste, and telegraphed to Mr Rimbolt to come to London.  Raby, bewildered and miserable, shut herself up in her room and was seen by no one.  It was a wretched night for everybody; and when next morning Mrs Rimbolt, sitting down to breakfast, was met with the news that neither Master Percy nor Miss Raby wanted breakfast, she began to feel that the affair was being overdone.  When Mr Rimbolt arrived, though he concealed his feelings better, he was perhaps the most mortified of all at the wretched misadventure which during his absence had turned Jeffreys adrift beyond recall.  He had known his secretary's secret, and had held it sacred even from his wife. And watching Jeffreys' brave struggle to live down his bad name, he had grown to respect and even admire him, and to feel a personal interest in the ultimate success of his effort.  Now, a miserable accident, which, had he been at home, could have been prevented by a word, had wrecked the work and the hopes of years, and put beyond Mr Rimbolt's power all further chance of helping it on.  About a week after Mr Rimbolt's return, when all but Percy were beginning to settle down again into a semblance of their old order of things, Raby knocked at her uncle's door and inquired if he was busy. She looked happier than he had seen her since his return.  The reason was easy to guess.  The post had brought her a letter from her father.  ""I thought you would like to see it,"" said she.  ""He has got leave at last, and expects to be home at the end of September.  Will you read the letter?"" added she, colouring; ""there's something else in it I should like you to see.""  The letter was chiefly about the prospects of coming home.  Towards the close Lieutenant-Colonel Atherton (for he had got promotion) wrote:  ""You ask me to tell you about poor Forrester and his family.""  ""He had no wife alive, and when he died did not know what had become of his only son.  The boy was at school in England--Bolsover School--and met with an accident, caused, it is said, by the spite of a schoolfellow, which nearly killed him, and wholly crippled him.  He was taken home to his grandmother's, but after she died he disappeared, and poor Forrester had been unable to hear anything about him.  It is a sad story.  I promised Forrester when I got home I would do what I could to find the boy and take care of him.  You will help, won't you?""  Raby watched her uncle as he read the passage, and then asked,--  ""I asked father to tell me something about the Forresters, uncle, because some one--it was Mr Scarfe--had told me that he believed Captain Forrester was the father of an old schoolfellow of his at Bolsover who had a bad accident.""  ""Is that all he told you?"" asked her uncle.  ""No,"" said Raby, flushing; ""he told me that Mr Jeffreys had been the cause of the accident.""  ""That was so,"" said Mr Rimbolt.  ""Sit down, child, and I'll tell you all about it.""  And her uncle told her what he had heard from Mr Frampton, and what Jeffreys had suffered in consequence; how he had struggled to atone for the past, and what hopes had been his as to the future.  Raby's face glowed more and more as she listened.  It was a different soldier's tale from what she was used to; but still it moved her pity and sympathy strangely.  ""It's a sad story, as your father says,"" concluded Mr Rimbolt; ""but the sadness does not all belong to young Forrester.""  Raby's eyes sparkled.  ""No, indeed,"" said she; ""it is like shipwreck within sight of the harbour.""  ""We can only hope there may be some hand to save him even from these depths,"" said Mr Rimbolt; ""for, from what I know of Jeffreys, he will find it hard now to keep his head above water.  Of course, Raby, I have only told you this because you have heard the story from another point of view which does poor Jeffreys injustice.""  ""I am so grateful to you,"" said the girl.  Mr Rimbolt let her go without saying more.  Even the man of books had eyes that could see; and Raby's face during this interview had told a tale of something more than casual sympathy.  The season dragged on, and nothing occurred to mend matters at Clarges Street.  Percy moped and could settle down to nothing.  He spurned his books, he neglected his horse, and gave up the river entirely.  It was vain to reason or expostulate with him, and after a couple of months his parents marked with anxiety that the boy was really ill.  Yet nothing would induce him to quit London.  Even his father's offer to take him abroad for a few weeks did not tempt him.  Raby herself made the final appeal the day before they started.  ""Percy, dear, won't you come for my sake?"" said she.  ""If I came for anybody I would for you,"" replied he, ""but I can't.""  ""But I had so looked forward to you seeing father.""  ""I'll see him as soon as he gets to town.""  ""It will spoil my pleasure so much,"" said she.  ""I shall be miserable thinking of you.""  ""You're an awful brick, Raby; but don't bother about me.  You'd all be ever so much more miserable if I came, and so should I.""  ""But what good can it do?"" pleaded his cousin.  ""I don't know--he might turn up.  I might find him after all.  If it hadn't been for your father coming, Raby--I'd have begged you to stay too.  He'd be more likely to come if he knew _you_ were here.""  Raby flushed.  Between Percy and his cousin there was no hypocrisy.  ""Oh, Percy,"" she said, ""do you want to make me fifty times more miserable?""  And she gave up further attempt to move him.  The travellers were away a month, during which time Percy kept his lonely vigil at Clarges Street.  As the reader knows, it was useless. Jeffreys was never near the place, and the lad, watching day after day, began slowly to lose hope.  But that month's experience was not wholly wasted.  Memories of bygone talks with his friend, of good advice given, and quiet example unheeded at the time, crowded in on Percy's memory now; adding to his sense of loss, certainly, but reminding him that there was something else to be done than mope and fret.  What would Jeffreys have had him do? he often asked himself; and the answer was plain and direct--work.  That had always been Jeffreys' cure for everything.  That is what he would have done himself, and that is what Percy, chastened by his loss, made up his mind to now.  He got out his old books and his tools, and doggedly took up the work where he had left it.  It was uphill, cheerless work, but he was better for it, and the memory of his lost friend became none the less dear for the relief it brought him.  Only one incident marked his solitary month at Clarges Street--that was a visit from Scarfe about a fortnight after the travellers had gone. Percy had a very shrewd guess, although he had never heard it in so many words, who was responsible for Jeffreys' disgrace and dismissal; and that being so, it is not to be wondered at that his welcome of the visitor was not very cordial.  ""Look here,"" said he, as Scarfe entered, and making no movement to return his greeting, ""is it true you were the fellow who told mother about Jeff, and had him sent away from here?""  ""My dear Percy--""  ""I'm not your dear Percy!  Did you tell mother that story about Jeffreys?""  ""Why, Percy, you don't mean to say--""  ""Shut up!  You can Yes or No, can't you?""  ""I did my duty, and it's a mercy you're all rid of him!"" said Scarfe, losing temper at being thus browbeaten by a boy of Percy's age.  ""Very well, you can go!  You're a cad, and you're not wanted here!"" said Percy.  ""You young prig!"" began the visitor; but Percy stopped him.  ""Look here,"" said he, ""if you want to fight, say so, and come on!  If you don't, go!  You're a cad!""  Scarfe was staggered by this outbreak; he never suspected the boy had it in him.  He tried to turn the matter off with a laugh.  ""Come, don't be a muff, Percy!  You and I are old friends--""  ""We're not; we're enemies!""  ""You mean to say,"" said Scarfe, with a snarl, ""you're going to throw me up for the sake of a--""  ""Don't say a word about Jeff!"" said Percy, white-hot, and springing to his feet; ""if you do I'll have you pitched neck and crop into the street!  Hook it!  No one asked you here, and you're not wanted!""  ""I came to see your mother,"" said Scarfe.  ""I can't congratulate you, Percy, on your hospitality, but I can hope you'll be better next time I come.""  Percy went out after him, and called down the staircase to Walker, ""Walker, give Mr Scarfe a glass of wine and some grub before he goes.""  The taunt about hospitality had stung him, and this was how he relieved his conscience on that point.  Scarfe was not the only visitor Percy had.  The evening before the travellers were expected home Walker announced that a gentleman had called inquiring for Mr Rimbolt, but hearing he was from home, desired to speak with his son.  Percy, ready to clutch at any straw of hope, and jumping at once to the conclusion that the only business on which any one could possibly call at the house was about Jeffreys, told Walker to show the gentleman up.  He was a dark, handsome man, with a few streaks of grey in his hair, and a keen, cold look in his eye which Percy mistrusted.  ""We're old friends, I fancy,"" said he, nodding to the boy as he entered. ""At least, I fancy I saw you sixteen or seventeen years ago.""  ""I must have been jolly young then,"" said Percy.  ""You were--about a week.  Your father and I were college friends.  I gave him up as a deserter when he married, and might have cut his acquaintance altogether, only as he happened to marry my sister, I was bound to keep up appearances and come and inspect my nephew when he made his appearance.""  ""You're my Uncle Halgrove, then?  I thought you were dead.""  ""I sympathise keenly with your disappointment.  I am alive and well, and hoped to find my brother-in-law at home.""  ""They'll be back to-morrow,"" said Percy.  ""Have you dined, my boy?""  ""No, not yet.""  ""That's well; they can lay for two.  I'll sleep here to-night.""  Percy scrutinised his uncle critically.  ""Look here, uncle,"" he said, rather nervously, ""it may be all right, you know, and I'd be awfully sorry not to be civil.  But I never saw you before, and didn't know you were alive.  So I think you'd better perhaps stay at your hotel to-night and come to-morrow, when they all come home. Do you mind?""  ""Mind?"" said Mr Halgrove.  ""I'm delighted if you are.  You prefer solitude, so do I.  Or perhaps you've been a naughty boy, and are left behind for your sins.""  ""I've stayed behind because I didn't want to go,"" said Percy.  ""Well,"" said Mr Halgrove, ""I am sure your relatives are the sufferers by your decision.  By the way, one of the things I came to see your father about was to ask him to help me out of a money difficulty.  I've just landed from America, and my remittances are not here to meet me. Consequently I am in the ridiculous position of not being able to pay for the luxury of an hotel.  But I understand there are nice clean railway-arches at Victoria, and that crusts are frequently to be met with in the gutters if one keeps his eye open.""  Percy was perplexed.  ""Do you mean you're really hard up?"" said he, ""because if you really are, of course you'd better put up here.""  ""But I may be a fraud, you know.  I may rob the house and murder you in your bed,"" said his uncle, ""and that would be a pity.""  ""I'll take my chance of that,"" said Percy.  And so it happened that the house in Clarges Street had a visitor on the last night of Percy's lonely month.  The boy and his uncle began the evening with a great deal of suspicion and mutual aversion.  But it wore off as the hours passed. Mr Halgrove had a fund of stories to tell, and the boy was a good listener; and when at last they adjourned to bed they were on friendly terms.  Percy, however, took the precaution to take away the front-door key, so that the visitor could not abscond from the house during the night without his knowledge.  The precaution was unnecessary.  Mr Halgrove rang his bell for shaving water at ten next morning with the confidence of one who had lived in the house all his life.  A few hours later the travellers arrived in London.    CHAPTER TWENTY SIX.  HIDE AND SEEK.  Percy was in considerable difficulty as to the ceremonies to be observed in welcoming his family home.  For he had no notion of leaving the house in possession of his suspicious uncle while he went down to the station. Nor could he bear the idea of not being at the station to meet them. So he compromised matters by taking his complaisant relative with him, much to that gentleman's amusement.  It relieved him considerably, when the train arrived, to see that his mother recognised the stranger, though not effusively, as her veritable brother.  He was thus able to devote his whole attention to his other uncle, whom he found considerably more interesting.  Colonel Atherton arrived in high spirits, like a schoolboy home for a holiday.  He struck up an alliance with Percy at once, and insisted on taking him off to the apartments near Regent's Park which were to be his and Raby's home for the next few months.  As he was saying good-bye to the Rimbolts, he caught sight for the first time of Mr Halgrove.  ""Why, bless me, is that you, Halgrove?"" he said.  ""Why, I've worn mourning for you, my boy.  This is a bit of sharp practice.  Where did you spring from?""  ""Perhaps I'm a ghost, after all.  So many people have told me lately I'm dead, that I begin to believe it.""  ""Never fear.  If you were a ghost we should be able to see through you-- that's more than anybody ever did with Halgrove, eh, Rimbolt?""  ""Halgrove is coming home with us,"" said Mr Rimbolt, ""so when you and Raby come to-morrow we can talk over old times.""  ""Who would have thought of him turning up?"" said the colonel to his daughter as with Percy they drove off in their cab.  ""Why, I've not heard of him since that affair of poor Jeffreys, and--""  ""Jeffreys!"" exclaimed Percy, with a suddenness that startled the gallant officer; ""did you say Jeffreys?""  ""Yes, what about him?  It was long before your time--a dozen or fourteen years ago.""  ""Why, he couldn't have been more than eight then; what happened to him, uncle, I say?""  The boy asked his question so eagerly and anxiously that it was evident it was not a case of idle curiosity.  ""You must be meaning the son; I'm talking about the father.  Wait till we get home, my boy, and you shall hear.""  It required all Percy's patience to wait.  The very mention of his friend's name had excited him.  It never occurred to him there were hundreds of Jeffreys in the world, and that his uncle and he might be interested in quite different persons.  For him there was but one Jeffreys in the universe, and he jumped at any straw of hope of finding him.  The reader knows all Colonel Atherton was able to tell Percy and Raby-- for Raby was not an uninterested listener--of the story of Mr Halgrove's partner.  Percy in turn told what he knew of his Jeffreys; and putting the two stories together, it seemed pretty clear it was a history of parent and son.  Early next morning the colonel was at Clarges Street, seated in the study with his two old college friends.  ""Well,"" said he, ""here's a case of we three meeting again with a vengeance.  And what have you been up to, Halgrove, these twenty years? No good, I'll be bound.""  ""I have at least managed to keep clear of matrimony,"" said Mr Halgrove, ""which is more than either of you virtuous family men can say.""  ""Ah, well,"" said the colonel, with a sigh, ""that's not all misfortune-- witness my sweet daughter and Rimbolt's fine boy.  What have you got to show against that?""  ""Nothing, I confess.""  ""By the way, though, haven't you?  The last I heard of you was in the papers; a record of a generous act on your part.  You had adopted the son of an unfortunate partner of yours who had died.  Is he still with you?""  ""No,"" said Mr Halgrove; ""that turned out an unfortunate speculation in every way.""  ""Did the boy bolt?""  ""Not exactly.  I sent him to a first-rate school, where he distinguished himself in a way of his own by an act of homicide.""  ""What?"" exclaimed the colonel; and Mr Rimbolt suddenly became attentive.  ""Yes.  He either quite or very nearly did for a young schoolfellow in a fit of the tantrums, and found it convenient to quit the place rather abruptly.""  ""What was the name of the school?"" asked Mr Rimbolt quietly.  ""Bolsover, in --shire.""  ""Singular!"" exclaimed the colonel.  ""I had a chum in India who had a boy at that very school.""  Here the speaker became aware of a sharp kick under the table and a significant look from Mr Rimbolt.  The old soldier was used to obey the word of command at a moment's notice and pulled up now.  ""I should think a thing like that would be very bad for the school,"" said Mr Rimbolt quietly, and in an off-hand way.  ""Fatal,"" said Mr Halgrove.  ""I believe Bolsover went to the dogs after it.""  ""And so you had--you had young--what was his name?""  ""Jeffreys.""  ""Young Jeffreys on your hands?""  ""Scarcely.  We parted company.  As I told him, I never was particular, but a man must draw the line somewhere, and I drew it at manslaughter.""  ""What became of him?""  ""Well, before I went abroad he was usher in a dame school in York.  He may be there still, unless by this time all his pupils are devoured.""  ""Very unpleasant business for you,"" said Mr Rimbolt.  ""And,"" asked the colonel, with a wink at his brother-in-law, ""did he, like the prodigal, take his portion of goods with him?  I mean what his father left him.""  Mr Halgrove for a moment raised his brows uncomfortably.  ""No,"" said he; ""Benjamin Jeffreys was an eccentric man, and invested his money in eccentric securities.  His son's money, like the lad himself, went to the dogs, and left me decidedly out of pocket by my term of guardianship.  I really advise neither of you to indulge your philanthropy in adopting somebody else's sons; it doesn't pay.""  ""Yours certainly was not a lucky experience,"" said Mr Rimbolt; ""however, when you were last heard of, Fame reported that you could afford to drop a little.""  ""_Fama volat_, and so does money.  No one could repeat the libel now with truth.  The fact is, this visit to an old college friend is a trifle interested.  My journey to the West has turned out badly, and, greatly as I should like it, I could not offer to lend either of you fellows a hundred pounds at this present moment.  So I hope you won't ask me.""  The talk here took a financial turn, and Mrs Rimbolt presently joining the party, she and her brother were left to themselves while Mr Rimbolt and the colonel took a short stroll.  Mr Rimbolt took the opportunity of telling his brother-in-law what he knew, not only of Jeffreys but of young Forrester, and the colonel told him of his obligation to find if possible the child of his dead companion-in-arms.  ""It's a mixed-up business altogether,"" said he, ""and from all I can judge something of a family matter.  My little girl, Rimbolt, whom you've been so good to, seems to me more interested in this librarian of yours than she would like any one to suspect--eh?""  ""I have fancied so,"" said Mr Rimbolt, ""sometimes.""  ""Pleasant to come home and find everybody in the dumps about some person one has never seen.  The sooner the rascal comes to light, the better for everybody and for my holiday.  By the way, Rimbolt, that struck me as fishy about Jeffreys' money, didn't it you?""  ""It did.  I had never heard anything about Halgrove having a partner.""  ""I had.  He went out of his mind and died by his own hand; but from what I knew of Halgrove then, I should say it was _he_ who had a weakness for eccentric speculations.  However, the money's gone; so it's all the same for young Jeffreys.""  Raby found her life at Regent's Park very different from that either at Wildtree or Clarges Street.  Colonel Atherton was a man who hated ceremony of any kind, and had a great idea of letting everybody do as they chose.  Raby consequently found herself her own mistress in a way she had never experienced before.  It was not altogether a delightful sensation; for though she loved her father's companionship and the care of looking after his wants, she often felt the time hang heavy on her hands.  The colonel had a number of old friends to look up, and a great deal of business to do; and Raby, used to company of some sort, found his absences lonely.  Percy was often at the house, but he in his present dismal mood was poor company.  His one topic was Jeffreys; and that to Raby was the last topic on which she felt drawn to talk to any one.  When, therefore, a neighbour suggested to her one day to give an hour or two a week to visiting the poor of the district, Raby hailed the proposal gladly.  It was work she had been used to at Wildtree, and to which she had already had yearnings in London, though Mrs Rimbolt had opposed it.  ""Mind?  Not a bit,"" said her father, when she broached the subject to him, ""as long as you don't get small-pox or get into mischief.  I should like to be a denizen of a slum myself, for the pleasure of getting a visit from you.""  And so the girl began her work of charity, spending generally an hour a day, under the direction of her friend, in some of the closely packed alleys near.  As she made a point of being home always to welcome her father in the afternoon, her visits were generally paid early in the day, when the men would be away at work and when the chief claimants on her help and pity would be the poor women and children left behind, with sometimes a sick or crippled man unable to help himself.  It was often sad, often depressing work.  But the brave girl with a heart full of love faced it gladly, and felt herself the happier for it day by day.  It was on an afternoon shortly after this new work had been begun that she was overtaken by a sudden October squall as she was hurrying back through Regent's Park towards home.  The morning had been fine, and she had neither cloak nor umbrella.  No cab was within sight; and there was nothing for it but to stand up under a tree till the rain stopped, or walk boldly through it.  She was just debating this question with herself when she became aware of an umbrella over her, and a voice at her side saying,--  ""This is most fortunate.  Miss Atherton.  Who would have thought of meeting you here?""  It was Scarfe; and Raby would sooner have met any one else in the world.  ""Thank you,"" said she, ""I shall be quite sheltered under this tree. Don't let me detain you.""  ""Nonsense!"" said he; ""you know I am delighted to be detained so pleasantly.  Won't you come farther under the trees?""  ""No, I must be home, thank you.  I don't want to be late.""  But just then the rain came down in such a deluge that she had nothing for it but to give in and stand up for shelter.  ""It seems ages since we met,"" began Scarfe.  Raby had a vivid enough recollection of that evening in the conservatory, but did not contradict him.  ""I called at Clarges Street last month, hoping to see you, but you were away.""  ""Yes, we were abroad--all but Percy.""  ""I saw Percy.  Poor fellow, he did not seem himself at all.  Miss Atherton, you must not blame me if I remind you of something we were talking about when I last saw you--""  ""Please don't, Mr Scarfe; I have no wish to refer to it.""  ""But I must.  Do you know, Raby, I have thought of no one but you ever since?""  Raby said nothing, and wished the rain would stop.  ""Is it too much to ask whether, perhaps once or twice, you have thought of me?""  Raby began to get angry.  Was it not cowardly to get her here at a disadvantage and begin to talk to her about what she had no wish to hear?  ""Yes--I have thought once or twice of you,"" she said.  ""How good of you, Raby!"" said he, trying to take her hand.  ""May I hope it was with something more than indifference--with love?""  ""Certainly not,"" said she, drawing back her hand, and, in spite of the rain, starting to walk.  Bitterly crestfallen, he walked at her side and held his umbrella over her.  ""You are harsh with me,"" said he reproachfully.  ""I am sorry.  You should not have provoked me.  I asked you not to talk about it.""  ""I am afraid, Miss Atherton,"" said he, ""some one has been prejudicing you against me.  Percy, perhaps, has been talking about me.""  Raby walked on without replying.  ""Percy is very angry with me for doing what it was only my duty to do as his friend--and yours.  He misunderstands me, and, I fear, so do you.""  ""I do not misunderstand you at all,"" said Raby boldly.  ""But I am afraid you do not thank me.""  ""No.  I have nothing to thank you for.""  ""I did my duty, at any rate.  I stated the truth, and nothing more, and should have been wrong to allow things to go on without at least trying, for the sake of those for whom I cared, and still care, Miss Atherton, to set them right.  Do I understand you blame me for that?""  ""Mr Scarfe, you have done a cruel thing to one who never did you harm-- and I see nothing to admire in it.""  Scarfe sneered.  ""Jeffreys is fortunate in his champion.  Perhaps, at least, Miss Atherton, you will do me the credit of remembering that on one occasion your hero owed his life to me.  I hope that, too, was not cowardly or cruel.""  ""If he had known the ruin you had in store for him, he would not have thanked you.""  Raby spoke with downcast eyes, and neither she nor Scarfe perceived the poor tramp on the path, who, as they brushed past him, glanced wistfully round at their faces.  ""He never thanked me,"" said Scarfe.  They walked on some distance in silence.  Then Scarfe said, ""Miss Atherton, you are unfair to me now.  You think I acted out of spite, instead of out of affection--for you.""  ""It is a kind of affection I don't appreciate, Mr Scarfe; and as the rain has nearly stopped I need not trouble you any more.  Thank you for the shelter, and good-bye.""  ""You really mean that you reject me--that you do not care for me?""  ""I do not.  I am sorry to say so--good-bye.""  And she left him there, bewildered certainly, but in no manner of doubt that she had done with him.  She told her father all about it that evening, and was a good deal reassured by his hearty approval of her conduct.  ""The kindest thing you could have done, instead of letting him dangle after you indefinitely.  Rough on him, perhaps; but that sort of fellow doesn't deserve much letting down.""  The reader has heard already how in the course of her visits of mercy Raby happened to find Jonah Trimble very near his end, and how she was able to cheer and lighten his dying hours.  Little dreamed she, as she sat by the death-bed that morning, and wrote those few dying words, into whose hands her little letter would fall, or what a spell they would work on the life of him who received them.  From the other neighbours she heard not a little about ""John,"" and sometimes wished she might chance to see him.  But he was away from early morning till late at night, and they never met.  Mrs Pratt in the room below, and her little dying daughter, had many a tale of kindness and devotion to tell about him; and when presently the little life fled, she heard with grateful tears of his act of mercy to the poor overwrought mother, and thanked God for it.  The time passed on, and one day early in December, when she returned home, she found her father in an unwonted state of excitement.  ""There's a clue, Raby, at last!"" he said.  ""A clue, father--you mean about young Forrester?""  ""About both.  It's the most mixed-up affair I was ever in.  Who do you suppose has written in answer to our advertisement about Forrester?""  ""Has he replied himself?"" asked Raby disingenuously; for she guessed the truth.  ""Not a bit of it.  The letter's from Jeffreys.  He doesn't sign his name, of course; but he writes to say that he was at Bolsover, and was responsible for the accident, and repeats what Rimbolt knows already about his trying to hear of them in his native place.  There's nothing very fresh about Forrester; but it may lead to our finding Jeffreys.""  ""Of course,"" said Raby, finding it hard to conceal her emotion, ""he has written to the lawyers.  Does he give an address, then?""  ""No--only a coffee-house in Drury Lane.  He's evidently on his guard against a trap.  He writes private and confidential; but you can see he is ready to do anything to find Forrester.""  ""What shall you do?""  ""Well, Rimbolt says leave it to the lawyers.  Of course we've no right to trap him, and Rimbolt thinks Wilkins & Wilkins had better not mention our names, but let him know they are acting for Forrester's executors. If he's not scared during the first visit or two, he may consent to see me, or Percy--and among us we may be able to help him out of his present condition, which, to judge by his letter, I should fancy is rather reduced.  He has been asked to call at Wilkins' on Wednesday, and they have promised to treat the matter as confidential--and we shall just have to trust they will manage to talk him round.""    CHAPTER TWENTY SEVEN.  A BRAND FROM THE BURNING!  Little suspecting the interest which his movements were causing elsewhere, Jeffreys, on the appointed Wednesday, presented himself at Messrs. Wilkins & Wilkins' office.  He was so much changed by eight months' misery and privation that no ordinary acquaintance would have recognised in the broken-down, haggard man who entered the office the once robust and stalwart librarian of Wildtree.  Even Percy would have had to look at him twice to make sure.  Mr Wilkins looked up curiously at his visitor.  ""Ah,"" said he, ""you have called in reference to that advertisement about Gerard Forrester.  Quite so.  Let me see.  I have your letter here, Mr --""  ""It is not necessary to know my name,"" said Jeffreys.  ""Just as you please.  Of course, as you say you were at Bolsover School with Forrester, and were the cause of his accident, it is hardly worth while making a mystery of it.""  ""I forgot that.  My name is John Jeffreys.""  ""Thank you.  It is a very proper thing of you to offer to assist us in our search, and I shall be glad if in the end you should become entitled to the reward which has been offered.""  ""I would not touch a farthing of it,"" said Jeffreys, with a scorn that astonished the lawyer.  ""Well, that's your affair.  I can understand you have some remorse for what has occurred, and would be glad to help, reward or no reward.""  ""I would give my life to find young Forrester.  Has anything been heard of him?""  ""Not much, though we have been able to trace him rather farther than you did.  We found a day or two ago a mention of the case of a lad suffering from the results of an accident such as he appears to have met with in one of the medical papers at the time.  The case was reported as having been treated at Middlesex Hospital, and I find on inquiry there that in the December of that year Gerard Forrester was a patient under treatment for some months, and in the May following was discharged as incurable. That, you see, was more than eighteen months ago.""  Jeffreys felt his heart thump excitedly as he listened.  It was little enough, but it seemed at least to bring him six months nearer to the object of his search.  ""After that,"" said Mr Wilkins, ""we are unable to discover anything. The address entered against his name in the hospital books, which was probably that of his old nurse, cannot now be found, as the street has been pulled down a year ago, and no one recollects him.  I saw the surgeon at the hospital, who remembered the case, and he explained to me that the boy when he left there might have lived a month or twenty years.  In any case he would always have to lie on his back.  It would be possible, he said, for him to use his hands--indeed, he believed during the last week or two of his stay in the hospital he had amused himself with drawing.""  ""He was considered good at drawing at Bolsover,"" put in Jeffreys.  ""So he may possibly have been able to earn a living of some sort.  The strange thing is that he does not appear to have written to any one.  He might have communicated with his former head-master, or some of his grandmother's friends at Grangerham, but he has not.  According to Colonel--to my client's account, he does not even appear to have written to his father, though it is possible a letter may have miscarried there. You have heard, no doubt, that his father died in action in Afghanistan in January?""  ""Yes, I heard that--very gallantly.""  ""Yes; in fact, the boy would, I believe, if he could be found, be entitled to a pension, besides what little property his father left. The account of the action, as well as our advertisements, have been in the papers.  If Gerard is alive, he is probably somewhere beyond the reach of the press, and for my own part I cannot see how he can be in any but destitute circumstances.""  This was all there was to say.  But Mr Wilkins' task was not yet done. He had been instructed to ascertain, if possible, something of Jeffreys' present condition, and to sound him as to his willingness to see again some of the friends of his old life.  ""I am afraid,"" said he, ""you too have had reverses, Mr Jeffreys.""  ""Never mind me, please,"" replied he.  ""You are living near here?""  ""No.""  ""You must excuse me if I take an interest in you--as a former schoolfellow of young Forrester's.  You have come through much since then?""  ""Not more than I deserve,"" said Jeffreys, fidgeting.  ""My client, I think, would have been glad to see you; but as you made a point of this interview being confidential, I was not justified in asking him to be present.""  ""Oh no.  I don't want to see any one.""  ""It would be a great help to my client, who is a stranger in London, if you, who know Forrester, would assist him.""  ""Who is your client, may I ask?""  ""My client,"" said Mr Wilkins, resolved to make the venture, ""is a Colonel Atherton, an old comrade of Captain Forrester, who has undertaken to try and find the boy and provide for him.""  Jeffreys started, and replied--  ""No; I will do anything to help by myself, but I do not wish to meet him.""  ""You know him, then?""  ""No, I have never seen him.""  ""He would, I can promise, respect your confidence, Mr Jeffreys.""  ""I know, but I cannot meet him or any one.  I will do anything he wants about searching for Forrester--he cannot be more anxious about it than I am--but I have every reason for wishing to remain unknown.""  ""You forget that it is hardly possible he can fail to know your name; and he has friends, some of whom I believe are deeply interested in your welfare.""  Jeffreys shuddered.  ""I can't say more,"" said he.  ""I will do all I can, but I want to see nobody but you.""  ""I may, of course, report this interview to my client?""  ""Of course; I can't prevent that.""  ""And I must tell him you definitely refuse to meet him.""  ""Yes.  I cannot see him.""  ""Or tell him your address?""  ""No; you know where a letter would find me.""  ""Well, will you call again--say this day week?""  ""Yes; to see you alone.""  Thus the unsatisfactory interview ended.  Mr Wilkins was a man of honour, and felt he had no right to insist on Jeffreys opening communications with the colonel; still less had he the right as he might easily have done, to track his footsteps and discover his hiding-place.  Jeffreys, alive to a sense of insecurity, evidently expected the possibility of some such friendly ruse, for he returned to his work by a long and circuitous course which would have baffled even the cleverest of detectives.  He seriously debated with himself that night the desirability of vacating his garret at Storr Alley and seeking lodgings somewhere else.  His old life seemed hemming him in; and like the wary hare, he felt the inclination to double on his pursuers and give them the slip.  For, rightly or wrongly, he had convinced himself that the one calamity to be dreaded was his recapture by the friends in whose house his bad name had played him so evil a revenge.  Yet how could he leave Storr Alley?  Had he not ties there?  Was it not worth worlds to him to hear now and then, on his return at night, some scrap of news of the ministering angel whose visits cheered the place in his absence?  He shrank more than ever from a chance meeting; but was it not a pardonable self-indulgence to stay where he could hear and even speak of her?  Nor was that his only tie now.  Mrs Pratt, in the room below, had never recovered yet from the illness that had prostrated her at little Annie's death; and night by night Jeffreys had carried the two babies to his own attic in order to give her the rest she needed, and watch over them in their hours of cold and restlessness.  He became an expert nurse.  He washed and dressed those two small brethren--the eldest of whom was barely three--as deftly and gently as if he had been trained to the work.  And he manipulated their frugal meals, and stowed them away in his bed, with all the art of a practised nurse.  How could he desert them now?  How indeed?  That very night, as he sat writing, with the little pair sleeping fitfully on the bed, a head was put in at the door, and a voice said in a whisper, ""Poor Mrs Pratt's gone, John.""  ""What,"" he said, ""is she dead?""  ""Yes--all of a sudden--the 'art done it--I know'd she was weak there. Poor dear--and her husband such a bad 'un too, and they do say she was be'ind with her rent.""  So the woman chattered on, and when at last she went, Jeffreys glanced at his two unconscious charges and went on writing.  No, he could not leave Storr Alley.  In the morning, as usual, he performed their little toilets, and announced to the elder that his mother was gone away, and they might stay upstairs.  Whereat the little orphan was merry, and executed a caper on the bare floor.  A fresh dilemma faced the newly made father.  He must work if he and his family were to eat.  The thirty shillings he had earned last week could not last for ever.  Indeed, the neighbours all seemed to take it for granted he would see to Mrs Pratt's burial; and how could he do otherwise?  That meant a decided pull on his small resources.  For a day or two he might live on his capital, and after that--  He put off that uncomfortable speculation.  The baby began loudly to demand its morning meal; and the three-year-old, having run through its mirth, began to whimper for its mother.  Altogether Jeffreys had a busy time of it.  So busy that when, about mid-day, Tim, who had been perched upon a box at the window to amuse himself at the peril of his neck by looking out into the court below, suddenly exclaimed--""There she is!"" he bounded from his seat like one electrified, and for the first time realised that _she_ might come and find him!  There was barely a chance of escape.  She had already entered the house; and he became aware of the little flutter which usually pervaded the crowded tenement when she set foot in it.  She had many families to visit, and each grudged her to the next.  The women had yards of trouble to unroll to her sympathy; and the children besieged her for stories and songs.  The sick lifted their heads as they heard her foot on the steps; and even the depraved and vicious and idle set their doors ajar to get a glimpse of her as she passed.  What could he do?  Wait and face her, and perhaps meet her look of scorn, or worse still, of forgiveness? or hide from her?  He debated the question till he heard her enter the chamber of death below.  Then there came over him a vision of her as he had last seen her that October afternoon with Scarfe in Regent's Park.  With a groan he gathered together his papers, and bidding Tim mind the baby till he returned, seized his hat and hurried from the room.  On the dark, narrow staircase he brushed against a dress which he knew must be hers.  For a moment he was tempted to pause, if only for a look at her face; but she passed on, and was gone before he could turn.  He went out miserably into the street, and waited within view of the entrance to the alley till she should come out.  She was long before she appeared--he guessed how those two friendless little orphans would detain her.  When she came her veil was down, and in the crowd on the pavement he lost sight of her in a moment.  Yet he knew her, and all his resolution once more wavered, as he reflected that he was still within reach of her voice and her smile.  He returned anxiously to the attic.  The baby lay asleep on the bed, and Tim, perched on his window seat, was crooning over a little doll.  There was a flower on the table; the scanty furniture of the room had been set in order, and his quick eye even noticed that a rent in Tim's frock which had caused him some concern in the morning had been neatly mended.  Tim came and put the little doll into his hands.  ""She gave it me.  Will she soon come again?"" said the child.  ""Yes; she's sure to come again.""  ""You ran away; you was afraid.  I wasn't.""  In a strange turmoil of emotions Jeffreys resumed his writing.  The flower in the cup beside him was only a half-withered aster, yet it seemed to him to perfume the room.  After dark the neighbour put her head into the room.  ""Then you didn't see the lady?"" said she.  ""No; I was out.""  ""It's a pity.  She's a angel, John.  The way she sat with them poor childer would do you good to see.  I told 'er you 'ad took them, and, bless you, 'er eyes filled with tears to think of a man doing it when you might let them go to the work'us.  Not that I wouldn't do it, John, if I 'adn't six of my own and the mangle and not room to turn round. And Mrs Parkes was a-saying the childer would be welcome in 'er room, only the smells is that bad in 'er corner that there's no living in it except for seasoned bodies.  There's my Polly, you know, John, is eight, and she would look after them now and again, when you're busy.  She's a good child, is Polly, and can write on a slate beautiful.""  Jeffreys thanked her, and promised to come to an arrangement with Polly, and went on with his work.  In due time the claims of hunger created a diversion, and he and his infants--one on each knee--partook of a comfortable repast of bread and milk.  He had hard work to induce the baby, after it was over, to resume his slumbers.  That young gentleman evidently had a vivid recollection of some one having walked about with him and sung him to sleep in the middle of the day, and he resented now being unceremoniously laid on his back and expected to slumber without persuasion.  Jeffreys had to take him up finally and pace the room for an hour, and about ten o'clock sat down to his interrupted work.  Till midnight he laboured on; then, cold and wearied, he put out his little candle and lay himself beside the children on the bed.  He had scarcely done so when he became aware of a glare at the window, which brought him to his feet in an instant.  It was a fire somewhere.  His first panic that it might be in the house was quickly relieved.  It was not even in Storr Alley, but in one of the courts adjoining.  He looked down from his window.  The alley was silent and empty.  No one there, evidently, had yet had an alarm.  Quickly putting on his boots, he hurried down, and made his way in the direction of the flames.  From below they were still scarcely visible, and he concluded that the fire, wherever it was, must have broken out in a top storey.  Driver's Court, which backed onto Storr Alley, with which it was connected at the far end by a narrow passage, was an unknown land to Jeffreys.  The Jews in Storr's had no dealings with the Samaritans in Driver's; for Storr Alley, poor as it might be, prided itself on being decent and hard-working, whereas Driver's--you should have heard the stories told about it.  It was a regular thieves' college.  A stranger who chanced into Driver's with a watch-chain upon him, or a chink of money in his pocket, or even a good coat on his back, might as soon think of coming out by the way he had entered as of flying.  There were ugly stories of murders and mysteries under those dark staircases, and even the police drew the line at Driver's Court, and gave it the go-by.  Jeffreys had nothing to apprehend as he rushed down the passage.  He had neither watch, chain, nor money, nor good coat.  His footsteps echoing noisily in the midnight silence brought a few heads to their windows, and almost before he stood in the court there was the cry of ""Fire!""  Terrible anywhere, such a cry in a court like Driver's was terrible indeed.  In a moment the narrow pavement swarmed with people, shouting, cursing, and screaming.  Although even yet the flames scarcely appeared from below, a panic set in which it was hopeless either to remove or control.  Chairs, tables, mattresses were flung, it seemed at random, from the windows.  Mothers, not venturing out on the stairs, cried down to those below to catch their children.  Drunken men, suddenly roused, reeled fighting and blaspheming into the court.  Thieves plied their trade even on their panic-stricken neighbours, and fell to blows over the plunder.  Still more terrible was the cry to others who remained within.  Children, huddled into corners, heard that cry, and it glued them where they stood.  The sick and the crippled heard it, and made one last effort to rise and escape.  Even the aged and bedridden, deserted by all, when they heard it, lay shouting for some one to help.  The flames, pent-up at first and reddening the sky sullenly through the smoke, suddenly freed themselves and shot up in a wild sheet above the court.  The crowd below answered the outburst with a hideous chorus of shrieks and yells, and surged madly towards the doomed house.  There was no gleam of pity or devotion in those lurid, upturned faces. To many of them it was a show, a spectacle; to others a terrible nightmare, to others a cruel freak of Providence, calling forth curses.  The flames, spreading downwards, had already reached the second floor, when a window suddenly opened; and a woman with wild dishevelled hair, put out her head and screamed wildly.  The crowd caught sight of her, and answered with something like a jeer.  ""It's Black Sal,"" some one shouted; ""she's kotched it at last.""  ""Why don't you jump?"" shouted another.  ""Booh?"" shouted a third.  ""Who skinned the cripple?""  The woman gave a scared look up and down.  The flames at that moment wrapped round the window, and, with a wild howl, the crowd saw her disappear into the room.  Jeffreys all this time had been standing wedged in the crowd, a spectator of that hideous scene, and now a witness of this last tragedy.  With a desperate effort he fought his way to the front, hitting right and left to make himself a passage.  It was a minute before he got through.  Then the crowd, realising as if by intuition his purpose, staggered back, and raised a howl as he dashed into the door of the half-consumed building.  The first flight of steps was still intact, and he was up it in a moment; but as he dashed up the second the smoke whirled down in his face and half-choked him.  He groped--for it was impossible to see--in search of the door; and guided partly by the roar of the crowd without, and partly by the shrieks within, he found the room.  It was full of flame as he entered it, and to all appearance contained nothing else.  The wretched woman, finding the stairs worse to face than the window, had rushed back there and flung herself desperately onto the heads of the crowd below.  As he turned to save himself, Jeffreys, amid the roar of the flames, caught the sound of a shout from the corner of the room which he had imagined to be empty.  Rushing towards it, he caught sight of a figure of a lad on the floor, blackened with smoke, and evidently unable to move.  Yet he was not senseless, for he called, ""I can't walk--help me.""  Jeffreys caught him in his arms in a moment, and only just in time.  He had literally to wade through flame to the door; and when he reached the stairs outside, the dense smoke, reddening every instant, burst upon him well-nigh overwhelmingly.  How he struggled down that awful flight with his burden he knew not. More than once he stumbled; and once a shower of fallen embers all but stunned him.  It was all done in a minute.  Those who watched without marvelled how soon he returned; and when they perceived that he bore in his arms a living creature, even Driver's Court swayed back to let him pass, and cheered him.  Happily a cry of ""Engines!"" at the other end of the court diverted the crowd still further, and enabled him to stagger forward clear of danger.  ""Drop him, he's a dead 'un!"" shouted some one who stopped a moment to peer into the face of the senseless lad.  ""I'll give you a shilling to help me with him out of this,"" said Jeffreys.  It was a shilling well spent.  Unaided he could never have done it, but with the sturdy gladiator to clear the way he was able at last to reach the comparative seclusion of Storr Alley.  The offer of another shilling prevailed on the man to carry the lad to the attic.  Then for the first time left to himself, he looked in the face of this unexpected guest.  And as he did so the room seemed to swim round him. He forgot where he was or what he was.  He looked down on an upturned face, but one not blackened with smoke.  It was white and livid, with green grass for a background--and the roar he heard was no longer the distant yell of a panic-stricken mob, but boys' voices--voices shouting at himself!  Yes, for the last time that vision rose before him.  Then with a mighty effort he shook off the dream and looked once more in the face of the boy who lay there on the floor of the Storr Alley garret. And as he did so young Forrester slowly opened his eyes.    CHAPTER TWENTY EIGHT.  COME BACK.  Raby had come home with a strange story from Storr Alley that afternoon. She was not much given to romance, but to her there was something pathetic about this man ""John"" and his unceremonious adoption of those orphan children.  She had not seen anything exactly like it, and it moved both her admiration and her curiosity.  She had heard much about ""John"" from the neighbours, and all she had heard had been of the right sort.  Jonah had talked bitterly of him now and then, but before he died he had acknowledged that John had been his only friend.  Little Annie had never mentioned him without a smile brightening her face; and even those who had complaints to pour out about everybody all round could find nothing to say about him.  Yet she seemed destined never to see him.  The next day, at her usual time, Raby turned her steps to Storr Alley. Groups of people stood about in the court, and it was evident, since she was last there, something untoward had happened.  A fireman's helmet at the other end of the alley, in the passage leading to Driver's Court, told its own tale; and if that was not enough, the smell of fire and the bundles of rags and broken furniture which blocked up the narrow pathway, were sufficient evidence.  The exiles from Driver's stared hard at the young lady as she made her way through the crowd; but the people of Storr Alley treated her as a friend, and she had no lack of information as to the calamity of the preceding night.  Raby paid several visits on her way up.  Then, with some trepidation, she knocked at the door of the garret.  There was no reply from within till she turned the handle, and said--  ""May I come in?""  Then a voice replied,--  ""Yes, if you like,"" and she entered.  It was a strange scene which met her eyes as she did so.  A lad was stretched on the bed, awake, but, motionless, regarding with some anxiety a baby who slumbered, nestling close to his side.  On the floor, curled up, with his face to the wall, lay a man sleeping heavily; while Tim, divided in his interest between the stranger on the bed and the visitor at the door, stood like a little watchdog suddenly put on his guard.  ""May I come in?"" said Raby again timidly.  ""Here she is!"" cried Tim, running to her; ""John's asleep, and he,""-- pointing to the figure on the bed--""can't run about.""  ""Correct, Timothy,"" said the youth referred to; ""I can't--hullo!""  This last exclamation was caused by his catching sight of Raby at the door.  He had expected a lodger; but what was this apparition?  ""Please come in,"" said he, bewildered; ""it's a shocking room to ask you into, and--Timothy, introduce me to your friend.""  Raby smiled; and how the crippled lad thought it brightened the room! ""Tim and I are friends,"" said she, lifting up the child to give him a kiss.  ""I'm afraid you are very badly hurt.  I heard of the fire as I came up.""  ""No, I'm all right; I'm never very active.  In fact, I can only move my hands and my head, as Timothy says.  I can't run, I'm a cripple.  I shouldn't be anything if it wasn't for Jeff.  Hullo, Jeff! wake up, old man!""  Raby started and turned pale as she raised her hand to prevent his waking the sleeper.  ""No, please, don't wake him; what did you say his name was?""  ""Jeffreys--John Jeffreys--commonly called Jeff.  He hauled me out of the fire last night, and guessed as little at the time who I was as I guessed who he was.  I can't believe it yet.  It's like a--""  ""You haven't told me your name,"" said Raby faintly.  ""Gerard Forrester, at your service.  Hullo, I say, are you ill?  Hi! Jeff, wake up, old man; you're wanted.""  Raby had only time to sink on a chair and draw Tim to her when Jeffreys suddenly woke and rose to his feet.  ""What is it, Forrester, old fellow? anything wrong?"" said he, springing to the bedside.  ""I don't know what's the matter--look behind you.""  ------------------------------------------------------------------------  ""Why did she cry?"" asked Tim presently, when she had gone.  ""I know; because of that ugly man,"" added he, pointing to Forrester.  ""Excuse me, young man, I have the reputation of being good-looking; that cannot have been the reason.  But, Jeff, I'm all in a dream.  Who is she? and how comes she to know you or me?  And, as Timothy pertinently remarks, `Whence these tears?'  Tell us all about it before the baby wakes.""  Jeffreys told him.  The story was the history of his life since he had left Bolsover; and it took long to tell, for he passed over nothing.  ""Poor old man!"" said Forrester, when it was done; ""what a lot you have been through!""  ""Have I not deserved it?  That day at Bolsover--""  ""Oh, for goodness' sake, don't go back to that.  You know it was an accident, and what was not an accident was the fault of my own folly. That night I awoke and saw you standing at the door, I knew that you had already suffered as much as I had.""  ""That was the last time I saw you.  You forget I have still to hear what happened to you afterwards.""  ""It's pretty easily told.  But I say, Jeff, what did you say her name was?""  ""Raby Atherton,"" said Jeffreys, smiling.  This was about the twentieth time the boy had broken in with some question about her.  ""She is the daughter of your guardian, Colonel Atherton, who was your father's comrade in Afghanistan.  Some day she will tell you the story of a battle out there which will make you proud of being Captain Forrester's son.  But I want to hear about you.""  ""I was taken home to Grangerham, you know.  My grandmother was ill at the time, and just starting South, so I was left in charge of my old nurse.  She was an awful brick to me, was that old soul, and I don't believe I know yet all she did and put up with for me.  ""The doctors at Grangerham couldn't make anything of me.  One said I'd be cutting about again in a few weeks, and another said I'd be buried in a few days.  It's hard to decide when doctors disagree at that rate, and old Mary gave it up, and did what was the best thing--kept me quietly at home.  Of course we thought that my grandmother had written to my father, but she hadn't, so he can't have heard for ages.  We heard of my grandmother's death presently, and then made the pleasant discovery that she had died in debt, and that the furniture of the house was hired. That pulled Mary and me up short.  She had saved a little, and I believe she spent every penny of that to get me up to London to a hospital.  I didn't have a bad time of it there for a month or two.  I was considered an interesting case, and had all sorts of distinguished fellows to come and look at me, and I lived like a fighting-cock all the time.  I found, as long as I lay flat, and didn't get knocked about, I was really pretty comfortable, and what was more, I could use my hands.  That was no end of a blessing.  I had picked up a few ideas about drawing you know, at Bolsover, and found now that I could do pretty well at it.  I believe some of my sketches at the Middlesex were thought well of.  Mary came to see me nearly every day.  I could see she was getting poorer and poorer, and when at last I was discharged, the little rooms she took me to were about as poor as they could be to be respectable.  ""I'd hardly been back a week, when one day after going out to try to sell some of my sketches, she came home ill and died quite suddenly.  I was all up a tree then--no money, no friends, no legs.  I wrote to Frampton, but he can't have got my letter.  Then I got threatened with eviction, and all but left out in the street, when the person old Mary had sold my sketches to called round and ordered some more.  I didn't see him, but a brute of a woman who lived in the house did, and was cute enough to see she could make a good thing out of me.  So she took possession of me, and ever since then I've been a prisoner, cut off from the outside world as completely as if I had been in a dungeon, grinding out pictures by the dozen, and never seeing a farthing of what they fetched, except in the food which Black Sal provided to keep me alive. Now and then, in an amiable mood, she would get me a newspaper; and once I had to illustrate a cheap edition of Cook's _Voyages_, and of course had the book to go by.  But she never let me write to anybody or see anybody, and mounted guard over me as jealously as if I had been a veritable goose that laid golden eggs.  ""You know the rest.  We got turned out when they pulled down the old place, and took refuge in Driver's Alley, a nice select neighbourhood; and there you found me, old man.""  ""Think of being near one another so long,"" said Jeffreys, ""and never knowing it.""  ""Ten to one that's exactly what my guardian's daughter is observing to herself at this moment.  I say, Jeff, compared with Driver's Court, this is a palatial apartment, and you are a great improvement on Black Sal; but for ah that, don't you look forward to seeing a little civilisation--to eating with a fork, for instance, and hearing an `h' aspirated; and--oh, Jeff, it will be heavenly to wear a clean collar!""  Jeffreys laughed.  ""Your two years' trouble haven't cast out the spirit of irreverence, youngster,"" said he.  ""It _is_ jolly to hear myself called youngster,"" said the boy, in a parenthesis; ""it reminds me of the good old days.""  ""Before Bolsover?"" said Jeffreys sadly.  ""Look here!  If you go back to that again, and pull any more of those long faces, Jeff, I'll be angry with you.  Wasn't all that affair perhaps a blessing in the long run?  It sent me to a school that's done me more good than Bolsover; and as for you--well, but for it you'd never have had that sweet visitor this morning.""  ""Don't talk of that.  That is one of the chief drawbacks to my going back into civilisation, as you call it.""  ""A very nice drawback--if it's the only one--""  ""It's not--there's another.""  ""What is that?""  ""My babies!""  It was a strange, happy night, that last in the Storr Alley garret. Jeffreys had begged Raby to let them stay where they were in peace for that day; and she considerately kept their counsel till the morning. Then she told her father the strange story.  ""Two birds with one stone, and such a stone!"" ejaculated the bewildered colonel.  ""Four birds, father--there are two babies as well.""  ""Whew!"" said the colonel, ""what a holiday I am having!""  ""Poor father,"" said the girl, ""it's too bad!""  ""Oh, well.  The more the merrier.  What's to be done now?  We'd better charter a coach and four and a brass band and go and fetch them home in state.  If they'd wait till to-morrow we would have up a triumphal arch too.""  ""How frivolous you are, father!  We must get them away with as little fuss as possible.  I arranged with Mr Jeffreys that he would bring Mr Forrester here in a cab this morning.""  ""And the babies?""  ""He will go back for them afterwards.""  ""Well, as you like; but what about Percy and the Rimbolts?""  ""Percy was to go out of town to-day, you know, and will not be back till to-morrow.  By that time we shall be able to find out what Mr Jeffreys would like best.""  ""Oh, very good.  We'll wait till his royal highness signifies his pleasure, and meanwhile our relatives and friends must be avoided-- that's what you mean.""  ""No,"" said Raby, colouring; ""but you know how easily frightened he is.""  The colonel laughed pleasantly.  ""All right, Raby; they shall be let down as easily as you like.  Now shall I be in the way when they come, or shall I make myself scarce? And, by the way, I must go at once and get a perambulator, and feeding- bottles, and all that sort of thing.  How many times a day am I to be sent out to take them walks?""  ""You're too silly for anything,"" said Raby dutifully.  She was grateful to him for making things so easy, and for covering her own ill-disguised embarrassment by this adroit show of frivolity.  There was no frivolity in the manner in which the gallant soldier welcomed his old comrade's son, when an hour later he entered the house, borne in the strong arms of his friend.  A couch was ready for him, and everything was made as simple and homelike as possible.  Jeffreys stayed long enough to help the boy into the civilised garments provided for him, and then quietly betook himself once more to Storr Alley.  The curiosity roused by the departure of `Black Sal's Forrester' in a cab was redoubled when, late that afternoon, Jeffreys was seen walking out of the alley with the baby in one arm and Tim holding onto the other.  He had considered it best to make no public announcement of his departure.  If he had, he might have found it more difficult than it was to take the important step.  As it was, he had to run a gauntlet of a score of inquisitive idlers, who were by no means satisfied with the assurance that he was going to give the children an airing.  The general opinion seemed to be that he was about to take the children to the workhouse, and a good deal of odium was worked up in consequence. Some went so far as to say he was going to sell or drown the infants; and others, Driver's Alley refugees, promised him a warm reception if he returned without them!  He neither returned with nor without them.  They saw him no more.  But it was given to the respectable inhabitants of a crescent near Regent's Park, about half an hour later, to witness the strange spectacle of a big young man, carrying a small baby in his arms and a big one on his shoulder--for Tim had turned restive on his hands-- walk solemnly along the footpath till he reached the door of Colonel Atherton's, where he rang.  The colonel and Raby had a queer tea-party that evening.  When the meal was ended, Jeffreys was called upon to put his infants to bed, and a wonderful experience to those small mortals was the warm bath and the feather-bed to which they were severally introduced.  Jeffreys was thankful that the baby was restless, and gave him an excuse for remaining in retirement most of the evening.  At length, however, silence reigned; and he had no further excuse.  Entering the parlour, he perceived almost with a shock that Mr Rimbolt was there.  He had called in accidentally, and had just been told the news.  ""My dear fellow,"" said he, as he took his old librarian's hand, ""how we have longed for this day!""  Raby and her father were occupied with Forrester, and Jeffreys and his old employer were left undisturbed.  What they talked about I need not repeat.  It chiefly had reference to Storr Alley and to Percy.  ""He is down at Watford seeing a friend to-night.  We expect him back to- morrow morning.  How happy he will be!  By the way,"" added Mr Rimbolt, a moment afterwards, ""now I remember, there is a train leaves Euston for Overstone at 12:30, half an hour after Percy's train comes in.  How should you like to meet him, and run down with him for a week or two to Wildtree?  He sadly wants a change, and my books sadly want looking after there.  You will have the place to yourselves, but perhaps you won't mind that.""  Jeffreys flushed with pleasure at the proposal.  It was the very programme he would have selected.  But for a moment his face clouded, as he glanced towards Forrester.  ""I don't know whether I ought to leave him?""  ""He is with his guardian, you know, and could not be in better quarters.""  ""Then--you know I have--that is, you know--there are two--babies.""  Raby, however, when the question was subsequently discussed, expressed herself fully equal to the care of these promising infants until a home could be found for them; and Forrester, for his part, declared that Jeffreys must and should go to Wildtree.  ""Can't you see I don't want you any more?"" said he.  ""This sofa's so comfortable, I'm certain I shall sleep a fortnight straight away, and then my guardian and I have no end of business to talk over, haven't we, guardian? and you'd really be in the way.""  So it was settled.  The whole party retired early to bed after their exciting day.  Jeffreys slept for the last time between the babies, and could scarcely believe, when he awoke, that he was not still in Storr Alley.  Still less could Tim when he awoke realise where he was.  For the John he was accustomed to stood no longer in his weather-beaten, tattered garments, but in the respectable librarian's suit which he had left behind him at Clarges Street, and which now, by some mysterious agency, found itself transferred to his present room.  Tim resented the change, and bellowed vehemently for the space of an hour, being joined at intervals by his younger brother, and egged on by the mocking laughter of young Forrester, who was enjoying the exhibition from the adjoining chamber.  For once Jeffreys could do nothing with his disorderly infants, and was compelled finally to carry them down one under each arm, to the sitting- room, where Raby came to the rescue, and thus established her claim on their allegiance for a week or so to come.  In a strange turmoil of feelings Jeffreys at mid-day walked to Euston. Mr Rimbolt was there with Percy's travelling bag and the tickets, but he did not remain till the train from Watford came in.  ""I may be running down to the North myself in about a fortnight,"" said he, as he bade good-bye; ""we can leave business till then--good-bye.""  The train came in at last.  Jeffreys could see the boy pacing in a nonchalant way down the platform, evidently expecting anything but this meeting.  His eyes seemed by some strange perversity even to avoid the figure which stood waiting for him; nor was it till Jeffreys quietly stepped in front of him, and said ""Percy,"" that they took him in and blazed forth a delighted recognition.  ""Jeff,"" he said, ""you've come back--really?""  ""Yes, really.""  ""To stay--for good?""  ""For good--old fellow.""  Percy heaved a sight of mighty content as he slipped his arm into that of his friend.  And half an hour later the two were whizzing northwards on their way to Wildtree, with their troubles all behind them.    CHAPTER TWENTY NINE.  A FRESH START.  It is supposed to be the duty of every well-conducted author, after the curtain has fallen on the final tableau of his little drama, to lift it, or half lift it, for a momentary last glimpse at the principal actors.  I am not quite sure whether this is not an encouragement to laziness on the part of the reader.  In most respects he is as well able to picture the future of Jeffreys, and Raby, and Percy, and Tim as I am.  I cannot show them to you in all the dignity of an honoured old age, because they are only a year or two older to-day than they were when Percy and Jeffreys took that little run together down to Cumberland. Nor can I show them to you, after the fashion of a fairy tale, ""married and living happily ever afterwards,"" because when I met Jeffreys in the Strand the other day, he told me that although he had just been appointed to the control of a great public library in the North, it would still be some months, possibly a year, before he would be able to set up house on his own account.  However, he seemed contented on the whole to wait a bit; and in a long talk we had as we walked up and down the Embankment I heard a good many scraps of information which made it possible to satisfy the reader on one or two points about which he may still be anxious.  Jeffreys and Percy stayed at Wildtree for a month, and the time was one of the happiest both of them ever spent.  They did nothing exciting. They read some Aristophanes, and added some new ""dodge"" to their wonderful automatic bookcase.  They went up Wild Pike one bright winter's day and had a glorious view from the top.  And on the ledge coming back they sat and rested awhile on a spot they both remembered well.  Julius's grave was not forgotten when they reached the valley below; and the ""J"" upon the stone which marks the place to this day was their joint work for an hour that afternoon.  As for the books, Jeffreys had sprung towards them on his first arrival as a father springs towards his long-lost family.  They were sadly in want of dusting and arranging, as for a month or two no one had been near them.  On the floor lay the parcels, just as they had arrived from the sale in Exeter; and altogether Jeffreys had work enough to keep him busy, not for one month only, but for several.  He was not sorry to be busy.  For amid all the happiness and comforts of his new return to life he had many cares on his mind.  There was Forrester.  He had imagined that if he could only find him, all would be right, the past would be cancelled and his bad name would never again trouble him.  But as he thought of the helpless cripple, lying there unable to move without assistance, with all his prospects blighted and his very life a burden to him, he began to realise that the past was not cancelled, that he had a life's debt yet to pay, and a life's wrong for which, as far as possible, to make amends.  But he bravely faced his duty.  Forrester's letters, which came frequently, certainly did not much encourage melancholy reflections.  ""I'm in clover here,"" the boy wrote about a week after Jeffreys had gone North.  ""One would think I'd done something awfully fine.  My guardian is a trump--and is ever tired of telling me about my father.  Do you know I'm to have a pension from a grateful country?  What wouldn't Black Sal say to get hold of me now?  What I value quite as much is his sword, which I keep by my couch like a Knight Templar.  So mind what you're up to when you come back.  ""Here am I writing about myself, when I know you are longing to hear about (turn over-leaf and hide your blushes)--the babies!  They are tip- top.  Timothy, ever since I got my sword, has shown great respect for me, and sits on the pillow while I sketch.  By the way, do you recognise enclosed portrait?  It's my first attempt at a face--rather a pleasant face too, eh?  Oh, about the babies.  The young 'un's cut a tooth.  The whole house has been agitated in consequence, and the colonel is as proud as if he'd captured a province.  So are we all.  They are to go to an orphanage, I believe, in a week or two; but not till you come back and give your parental benediction.  My guardian is going to write you all about it.  He promises military openings for both when they arrive at the proper age; and Tim is practising already on a drum which _she_ has given him.  ""She, by the way, never mentions you, which is an excellent sign, but rather rough on me when I want to talk about you.  She occasionally is drawn out to talk about a certain Mr John at Storr Alley; but, as you know, she only knew about him from hearsay.  How's that boy who has got hold of you down in Cumberland?  Are he and I to be friends or enemies? Tell him I'm game for either, and give him choice of weapons if the latter.  But as long as he lets me see you now and then and treats you well, we may as well be friends.  I'm flourishing and awfully in love. Stay away as long as you can; you're not wanted here.  The lady of Clarges Street came to see me yesterday.  She sent you really a kind message; so even in that quarter you may yet look for a friend.  Good- bye--remember me to that chap.  Tim sends his duty; and _she_ when I mentioned I was writing to you and asked if there was any message, did not hear what I said.--G.F.""  There was plenty in this bright letter to give comfort to Jeffreys.  He rejoiced humbly in its affectionate tone towards himself.  He treasured the portrait.  He was gratified at the unenvious references to Percy, and he was relieved at the prospect before his babies.  The part that referred to Raby left him less room for jubilation. Forrester evidently thought, as Percy did, that in that quarter everything was plain sailing.  They neither of them realised the gulf between the two, and they neither of them knew of that miserable October afternoon in Regent's Park.  Forrester's jocular reference to Raby's silence and reserve seemed to Jeffreys but a confirmation of what he believed to be the truth.  He was to her what any other friend in distress might be, an object of sweet pity and solicitude.  But that was all.  He had a bad name, and much as she would brave for him to help him, she did not--how could she?--love him.  At the end of a month Mr Rimbolt wrote to say he was coming down to Wildtree, and would be glad if Percy and Jeffreys would meet him with the carriage at Overstone.  They did so, and found that he was not alone.  Mr Halgrove stepped pleasantly out of the train at the same time and greeted his quondam ward with characteristic ease.  ""Ah, Jeffreys--here we are again.  I'm always meeting you at odd places. How fresh everything looks after the rain!""  ""Mr Halgrove is my brother-in-law, you know, Jeffreys,"" said Mr Rimbolt, in response to his librarian's blank look of consternation.  ""I brought him down, as he wanted to see you and have a talk.  If you two would like to walk,"" added he, ""Percy and I will drive on, and have dinner ready by the time you arrive.""  ""Good-hearted fellow, Rimbolt,"" said Mr Halgrove, as they started to walk, ""he always was.  That's Wild Pike, I suppose?""  ""Yes,"" said Jeffreys, greatly puzzled at this unexpected meeting.  ""Yes, Rimbolt's a good fellow; and doesn't mind telling bad fellows that they aren't.  You'll smile, Jeffreys; but he has actually made me uncomfortable sometimes.""  ""Really?"" said Jeffreys, thinking it must have been some very remarkable effort which succeeded in accomplishing, that wonder.  ""Yes.  I told him once casually about an unpleasant ward I once had, whom I rather disliked.  I thought he would sympathise with me when I related how delicately I had got rid of him and sent him adrift when it did not suit me to keep him any longer.  Would you believe it, Rimbolt wasn't at all sympathetic, but asked what had become of my ward's money! Do take warning, Jeffreys, and avoid the bad habit of asking inconvenient questions.  You have no idea of the pain they may cause. Mr Rimbolt's question pained me excessively.  Because my ward's money, like himself, had gone to the bad.  That would not have been of much consequence, were it not that I was responsible for its going to the bad.  It was most inconvenient altogether, I assure you.  It made me feel as if I had behaved not quite well in the matter; and you know how depressing such a feeling would be.  Still more inconvenient at the time when I had this talk with Rimbolt about six months ago, I had just come back from America with my finances in not at all a flourishing condition, so that if even I had been disposed to refund my ward, I could not have done it.  Happily he was lost.  It was an immense relief to me, I can assure you.  ""Two months ago my finances looked up.  I had news that some of my Yankee speculations were turning out well, and I unexpectedly found myself a man of means again.  Rimbolt, who certainly has the knack of making ill-timed suggestions, proposed that that would be a good opportunity for making good what properly belonged to my ward.  I urged in vain that my ward was lost, and that the money properly belonged to me as a reward for the trouble I had had in the matter.  He actually insisted that I should deposit with him, as trustee for my ward, the full amount of what belonged to him, with interest added to date, promising if by any unfortunate accident the fellow should be found, to see it came into his hands.  One's obliged to humour Rimbolt, so I did what he wanted, and that's how it stands.  If ever this unprofitable ward turns up, he'd better keep his eye on Rimbolt.  ""There, you see, Jeffreys, that's just a little anecdote to show you how easy it is, by being inconsiderate, for one person to make another uncomfortable.  But now tell me how you like Cumberland.  You must be quite a mountaineer by this time.""  Jeffreys admitted he was pretty good, and had the tact to suit his humour to that of his guardian, and not refer further to the lost ward or his money.  Mr Halgrove stayed two days, and then departed for the Great West, where it is possible he may to-day carry a lighter heart about with him for his latest act of reparation.  Before the trio at Wildtree returned to London, Jeffreys, greatly to Percy's terror, asked leave to go for two days to York.  The boy seemed still not quite sure that he had got back his friend for good, and highly disapproved now of putting the temptation to ""bolt again,"" as he called it, in his way.  However, Jeffreys ""entered into recognisances"" to come back, and even offered to take Percy with him on his journey. The offer was not accepted, for Percy knew Jeffreys would sooner go alone.  But it allayed the boy's uneasiness.  Jeffreys had much trouble to discover Mrs Trimble.  Galloway House was still an educational establishment, but its present conductor knew nothing of the lady whose ""goodwill and connection"" he had purchased so cheaply two years ago.  Finally Jeffreys decided to call at Ash Cottage.  The walk up that familiar lane recalled many a strange memory.  The bank whereon he had sat that eventful early morning was unchanged, and had lost all traces of Jonah's excavations.  The railway embankment he had half thought of helping to construct was already overgrown with grass, and thundered under the weight of trains every few minutes.  Ash Cottage had not changed a plank or a tile since he last saw it. There were the same cracks in the wall of the shed, the same bushes on either side of the gate--nay, he was sure those wisps of hay clinging to the branches of the holly had been there two years ago.  As he walked somewhat doubtfully towards the house--for he could hardly forget under what circumstances he had last seen Farmer Rosher--he heard a boy's shout behind him, and looking round, perceived Freddy and Teddy giving chase.  ""It _is_ Jeff!"" shouted Freddy.  ""I knew him a mile away.""  ""I saw him first.  We knew you'd come back, Jeff; huzzah!""  ""That tricycle wants looking to awful bad.  Our feet touch the ground on it now, Jeff.""  ""Come on to the shed, I say, and put it right.  _How_ brickish of you to come back, Jeff!""  A long afternoon the happy Jeff spent over that intractable tricycle. It was past all repair; but no feat of engineering was ever applauded as were the one or two touches by which he contrived to make it stand upright and bear the weight of a boy.  Before the work was over Farmer Rosher had joined them, well pleased at his boys' delight.  ""Thee's paid oop for thy sin, lad,"" said he.  ""I did thee and the lads more harm than I meant; but thee's a home here whenever thee likes, to make up for it; and come away and see the missus and have a drop of tea.""  From the farmer, who may have had good reason for knowing, Jeffreys learned that Mrs Trimble was comfortably quartered in an almshouse; and there, next morning--for there was do escaping from Ash Cottage that night--he found her, and soothed her with the news he had to tell of her poor prodigal.  ""Well, well,"" she said, ""God is merciful; and He will reward you, John, as He had pity on the lad.  And now will you be sure and take a mother's blessing to the sweet lady, and tell her if she ever wants to make an old woman happy, he has only to come here, and let me see her and kiss her for what she has done for me and mine?""  That message he delivered a week later as he walked with Raby one afternoon in Regent's Park.  It was not exactly a chance walk.  They had both been up to the orphanage at Hampstead with the reluctant Tim and his brother, to leave them there in good motherly hands till the troubles of infancy should be safely passed.  It was Tim who had insisted on having the escort of both his natural guardians on the occasion; and at such a time and on such an errand Tim's word was law.  So they had gone all four in a cab, and now Raby and Jeffreys returned, and with a sense of bereavement, through the Park.  ""I will certainly go and see Mrs Trimble when next I am North,"" said Raby, ""though I wish I deserved half her gratitude.""  ""You deserve it all.  You were an angel of light to that poor fellow.""  They walked on some way in silence.  Then she said--  ""Storr Alley is so different now, Mr Jeffreys.  A family of seven is in your garret.  You would hardly know the place.""  ""It would be strange indeed if I did not, for I too saw light there.""  ""How wonderful it all was!"" said Raby.  ""When Jonah was telling me about his good protector, John, how little I dreamed it was you!""  ""And when you wrote this little letter,"" said he, showing her the precious scrap of paper, ""how little you dreamed who would bless you for it!""  ""The blessing belonged, did it not, to Him Who has been leading us all, in mercy, in His own way?""  Again they walked in silence.  Was it accident, or what, which brought them, without knowing it, to a spot which to each was full of painful memories?  Raby was the first to stop abruptly.  ""Let us go another way, Mr Jeffreys, if you don't mind.  I don't like this avenue.""  ""No more do I,"" said Jeffreys, who had stopped too.  ""Why?"" she asked.  ""Need I say?""  ""Not if you don't like.""  ""I have not walked down here since an afternoon last October.  There was a sudden storm of rain--""  ""What!  Were you here then?""  ""I was.  You did not see me.""  ""You saw me then.  I was with Mr Scarfe.""  ""Yes.  You were--""  ""Miserable and angry,"" said she, her face kindling at the recollection.  He darted one glance at her, as brief as that he had darted on the afternoon of which they spoke.  Then, he had read nothing but despair for himself; now, though her eyes were downcast and her voice angry, he thought he read hope.  ""Suppose,"" said he, in a little while, ""instead of running away from the path, we just walk down it together.  Would you mind?  Are you afraid?""  ""No,"" she said, smiling.  And they walked on.  THE END.

In this tale I have left the battlefields of history, and have written a story of adventure in Australia, in the early days when the bush rangers and the natives constituted a real and formidable danger to the settlers. I have done this, not with the intention of extending your knowledge, or even of pointing a moral, although the story is not without one; but simply for a change--a change both for you and myself, but frankly, more for myself than for you. You know the old story of the boy who bothered his brains with Euclid, until he came to dream regularly that he was an equilateral triangle enclosed in a circle. Well, I feel that unless I break away sometimes from history, I shall be haunted day and night by visions of men in armour, and soldiers of all ages and times.  If, when I am away on a holiday I come across the ruins of a castle, I find myself at once wondering how it could best have been attacked, and defended. If I stroll down to the Thames, I begin to plan schemes of crossing it in the face of an enemy; and if matters go on, who can say but that I may find myself, some day, arrested on the charge of surreptitiously entering the Tower of London, or effecting an escalade of the keep of Windsor Castle! To avoid such a misfortune--which would entail a total cessation of my stories, for a term of years--I have turned to a new subject, which I can only hope that you will find as interesting, if not as instructive, as the other books which I have written.  G. A. Henty.    Chapter 1: The Broken Window.   ""You are the most troublesome boy in the village, Reuben Whitney, and you will come to a bad end.""  The words followed a shower of cuts with the cane. The speaker was an elderly man, the master of the village school of Tipping, near Lewes, in Sussex; and the words were elicited, in no small degree, by the vexation of the speaker at his inability to wring a cry from the boy whom he was striking. He was a lad of some thirteen years of age, with a face naturally bright and intelligent; but at present quivering with anger.  ""I don't care if I do,"" he said defiantly. ""It won't be my fault, but yours, and the rest of them.""  ""You ought to be ashamed of yourself,"" the master said, ""instead of speaking in that way. You, who learn easier than anyone here, and could always be at the top of your class, if you chose. I had hoped better things of you, Reuben; but it's just the way, it's your bright boys as mostly gets into mischief.""  At this moment the door of the school room opened, and a lady with two girls, one of about fourteen and the other eleven years of age, entered.  ""What is the matter now?"" the lady asked, seeing the schoolmaster, cane in hand, and the boy standing before him.  ""Reuben Whitney! What, in trouble again, Reuben? I am afraid you are a very troublesome boy.""  ""I am not troublesome, ma'm,"" the boy said sturdily. ""That is, I wouldn't be if they would let me alone; but everything that is done bad, they put it down to me.""  ""But what have you been doing now, Reuben?""  ""I have done nothing at all, ma'm; but he's always down on me,"" and he pointed to the master, ""and when they are always down on a fellow, it's no use his trying to do right.""  ""What has the boy been doing now, Mr. White?"" the lady asked.  ""Look there, ma'm, at those four windows all smashed, and the squire had all the broken panes mended only a fortnight ago.""  ""How was it done, Mr. White?""  ""By a big stone, ma'm, which caught the frame where they joined, and smashed them all.""  ""I did not do it, Mrs. Ellison, indeed I didn't.""  ""Why do you suppose it was Reuben?"" Mrs. Ellison asked the master.  ""Because I had kept him in, half an hour after the others went home to dinner, for pinching young Jones and making him call out; and he had only just gone out of the gate when I heard the smash; so there is no doubt about it, for all the others must have been in at their dinner at that time.""  ""I didn't do it, ma'm,"" the boy repeated. ""Directly I got out of the gate, I started off to run home. I hadn't gone not twenty yards when I heard a smash; but I wasn't going for to stop to see what it was. It weren't no business of mine, and that's all I know about it.""  ""Mamma,"" the younger of the two girls said eagerly, ""what he says is quite true. You know you let me run down the village with the jelly for Mrs. Thomson's child, and as I was coming down the road I saw a boy come out of the gate of the school and run away; and then I heard a noise of broken glass, and I saw another boy jump over the hedge opposite, and run, too. He came my way and, directly he saw me, he ran to a gate and climbed over.""  ""Do you know who it was, Kate?"" Mrs. Ellison asked.  ""Yes, mamma. It was Tom Thorne.""  ""Is Thomas Thorne here?"" Mrs. Ellison asked in a loud voice.  There was a general turning of the heads of the children to the point where a boy, somewhat bigger than the rest, had been apparently studying his lessons with great diligence.  ""Come here, Tom Thorne,"" Mrs. Ellison said.  The boy slouched up with a sullen face.  ""You hear what my daughter says, Tom. What have you to say in reply?""  ""I didn't throw the stone at the window,"" the boy replied. ""I chucked it at a sparrow, and it weren't my fault if it missed him and broke the window.""  ""I should say it was your fault, Tom,"" Mrs. Ellison said sharply--""very much your fault, if you throw a great stone at a bird without taking care to see what it may hit. But that is nothing to your fault in letting another boy be punished for what you did. I shall report the matter to the squire, and he will speak to your father about it. You are a wicked, bad boy.  ""Mr. White, I will speak to you outside.""  Followed by her daughters, Mrs. Ellison went out; Kate giving a little nod, in reply to the grateful look that Reuben Whitney cast towards her, and his muttered:  ""Thank you, miss.""  ""Walk on, my dears,"" Mrs. Ellison said. ""I will overtake you, in a minute or two.  ""This will not do, Mr. White,"" she said, when she was alone with the master. ""I have told you before that I did not approve of your thrashing so much, and now it is proved that you punish without any sufficient cause, and upon suspicion only. I shall report the case at once to the squire and, unless I am greatly mistaken, you will have to look out for another place.""  ""I am very sorry, Mrs. Ellison, indeed I am; and it is not often I use the cane, now. If it had been anyone else, I might have believed him; but Reuben Whitney is always in mischief.""  ""No wonder he is in mischief,"" the lady said severely, ""if he is punished, without a hearing, for all the misdeeds of others. Well, I shall leave the matter in the squire's hands; but I am sure he will no more approve than I do of the children being ill treated.""  Reuben Whitney was the son of a miller, near Tipping. John Whitney had been considered a well-to-do man, but he had speculated in corn and had got into difficulties; and his body was, one day, found floating in the mill dam. No one knew whether it was the result of intention or accident, but the jury of his neighbours who sat upon the inquest gave him the benefit of the doubt, and brought in a verdict of ""accidental death."" He was but tenant of the mill and, when all the creditors were satisfied, there were only a few pounds remaining for the widow.  With these she opened a little shop in Tipping, with a miscellaneous collection of tinware and cheap ironmongery; cottons, tapes, and small articles of haberdashery; with toys, sweets, and cakes for the children. The profits were small, but the squire, who had known her husband, charged but a nominal rent for the cottage; and this was more than paid by the fruit trees in the garden, which also supplied her with potatoes and vegetables, so that she managed to support her boy and herself in tolerable comfort.  She herself had been the daughter of a tradesman in Lewes, and many wondered that she did not return to her father, upon her husband's death. But her home had not been a comfortable one, before her marriage; for her father had taken a second wife, and she did not get on well with her stepmother. She thought, therefore, that anything would be better than returning with her boy to a home where, to the mistress at least, she would be most unwelcome.  She had, as a girl, received an education which raised her somewhat above the other villagers of Tipping; and of an evening she was in the habit of helping Reuben with his lessons, and trying to correct the broadness of dialect which he picked up from the other boys. She was an active and bustling woman, managed her little shop well, and kept the garden, with Reuben's assistance, in excellent order.  Mrs. Ellison had, at her first arrival in the village three years before, done much to give her a good start, by ordering that all articles of use for the house, in which she dealt, should be purchased of her; and she highly approved of the energy and independence of the young widow. But lately there had been an estrangement between the squire's wife and the village shopkeeper. Mrs. Ellison, whose husband owned all the houses in the village, as well as the land surrounding it, was accustomed to speak her mind very freely to the wives of the villagers. She was kindness itself, in cases of illness or distress; and her kitchen supplied soups, jellies, and nourishing food to all who required it; but in return, Mrs. Ellison expected her lectures on waste, untidiness, and mismanagement to be listened to with respect and reverence.  She was, then, at once surprised and displeased when, two or three months before, having spoken sharply to Mrs. Whitney as to the alleged delinquencies of Reuben, she found herself decidedly, though not disrespectfully, replied to.  ""The other boys are always set against my Reuben,"" Mrs. Whitney said, ""because he is a stranger in the village, and has no father; and whatever is done, they throw it on to him. The boy is not a bad boy, ma'm--not in any way a bad boy. He may get into mischief, like the rest; but he is not a bit worse than others, not half as bad as some of them, and those who have told you that he is haven't told you the truth.""  Mrs. Ellison had not liked it. She was not accustomed to be answered, except by excuses and apologies; and Mrs. Whitney's independent manner of speaking came upon her almost as an act of rebellion, in her own kingdom. She was too fair, however, to withdraw her custom from the shop; but from that time she had not, herself, entered it.  Reuben was a source of anxiety to his mother, but this had no reference to his conduct. She worried over his future. The receipts from the shop were sufficient for their wants; and indeed the widow was enabled, from time to time, to lay by a pound against bad times; but she did not see what she was to do with the boy. Almost all the other lads of the village, of the same age, were already in the fields; and Mrs. Whitney felt that she could not much longer keep him idle. The question was, what was she to do with him? That he should not go into the fields she was fully determined, and her great wish was to apprentice him to some trade; but as her father had recently died, she did not see how she was to set about it.  That evening, at dinner, Mrs. Ellison told the squire of the scene in the school room.  ""White must go,"" he said, ""that is quite evident. I have seen, for some time, that we wanted a younger man, more abreast of the times than White is; but I don't like turning him adrift altogether. He has been here upwards of thirty years. What am I to do with him?""  Mrs. Ellison could make no suggestion; but she, too, disliked the thought of anyone in the village being turned adrift upon the world.  ""The very thing!"" the squire exclaimed, suddenly. ""We will make him clerk. Old Peters has long been past his work. The old man must be seventy-five, if he's a day, and his voice quavers so that it makes the boys laugh. We will pension him off. He can have his cottage rent free, and three or four shillings a week. I don't suppose it will be for many years. As for White, he cannot be much above sixty. He will fill the place very well.  ""I am sure the vicar will agree, for he has been speaking to me, about Peters being past his work, for the last five years. What do you say, my dear?""  ""I think that will do very well, William,"" Mrs. Ellison replied, ""and will get over the difficulty altogether.""  ""So you see, wife, for once that boy of Widow Whitney's was not to blame. I told you you took those stories on trust against him too readily. The boy's a bit of a pickle, no doubt; and I very near gave him a thrashing, myself, a fortnight since, for on going up to the seven-acre field, I found him riding bare backed on that young pony I intended for Kate.""  ""You don't say so, William!"" Mrs. Ellison exclaimed, greatly shocked. ""I never heard of such an impudent thing. I really wonder you didn't thrash him.""  ""Well, perhaps I should have done so, my dear; but the fact is, I caught sight of him some time before he saw me, and he was really sitting her so well that I could not find it in my heart to call out. He was really doing me a service. The pony had never been ridden, and was as wild as a wild goat. Thomas is too old, in fact, to break it in, and I should have had to get someone to do it, and pay him two or three pounds for the job.  ""It was not the first time the boy had been on her back, I could see. The pony was not quite broken and, just as I came on the scene, was trying its best to get rid of him; but it couldn't do it, and I could see, by the way he rode her about afterwards, that he had got her completely in hand; and a very pretty-going little thing she will turn out.""  ""But what did you say to him, William? I am sure I should never stop to think whether he was breaking in the pony, or not, if I saw him riding it about.""  ""I daresay not, my dear,"" the squire said, laughing; ""but then you see, you have never been a boy; and I have, and can make allowances. Many a pony and horse have I broken in, in my time; and have got on the back of more than one, without my father knowing anything about it.""  ""Yes, but they were your father's horses, William,"" Mrs. Ellison persisted. ""That makes all the difference.""  ""I don't suppose it would have made much difference to me,"" the squire laughed, ""at that time. I was too fond of horse flesh, even from a boy, to be particular whose horse it was I got across. However, of course, after waiting till he had done, I gave the young scamp a blowing up.""  ""Not much of a blowing up, I am sure,"" Mrs. Ellison said; ""and as likely as not, a shilling at the end of it.""  ""Well, Mary, I must own,"" the squire said pleasantly, ""that a shilling did find its way out of my pocket into his.""  ""It's too bad of you, William,"" Mrs. Ellison said indignantly. ""Here is this boy, who is notoriously a scapegrace, has the impertinence to ride your horse, and you encourage him in his misdeeds by giving him a shilling.""  ""Well, my dear, don't you see, I saved two pounds nineteen by the transaction.  ""Besides,"" he added more seriously, ""I think the boy has been maligned. I don't fancy he's a bad lad at all. A little mischief and so on, but none the worse for that. Besides, you know, I knew his father; and have sat many a time on horseback chatting to him, at the door of his mill; and drank more than one glass of good ale, which his wife has brought out to me. I am not altogether easy in my conscience about them. If there had been a subscription got up for the widow at his death, I should have put my name down for twenty pounds; and all that I have done for her is to take eighteen pence a week off that cottage of theirs.  ""No, I called the boy to me when he got off, and pretty scared he looked when he saw me. When he came up, I asked him how he dared to ride my horses about, without my leave. Of course he said he was sorry, which meant nothing; and he added, as a sort of excuse, that he used from a child to ride the horses at the mill down to the ford for water; and that his father generally had a young one or two, in that paddock of his by the mill, and he used often to ride them; and seeing the pony one day, galloping about the field and kicking up its heels, he wondered whether he could sit a horse still, and especially whether he could keep on that pony's back. Then he set to, to try.  ""The pony flung him several times, at first; and no wonder, as he had no saddle, and only a piece of old rope for a bridle; but he mastered him at last, and he assured me that he had never used the stick, and certainly he had not one when I saw him. I told him, of course, that he knew he ought not to have done it; but that, as he had taken it in hand, he might finish it. I said that I intended to have it broken in for Kate, and that he had best get a bit of sacking and put it on sideways, to accustom the pony to carry a lady. Then I gave him a shilling, and told him I would give him five more, when he could tell me the pony was sufficiently broken and gentle to carry Kate.""  Mrs. Ellison shook her head in disapprobation.  ""It is of no use, William, my talking to the villagers as to the ways of their boys, if that is the way you counteract my advice.""  ""But I don't always, my dear,"" the squire said blandly. ""For instance, I shall go round tomorrow morning with my dog whip to Thorne's; and I shall offer him the choice of giving that boy of his the soundest thrashing he ever had, while I stand by to see it, or of going out of his house at the end of the quarter.  ""I rather hope he will choose the latter alternative. That beer shop of his is the haunt of all the idle fellows in the village. I have a strong suspicion that he is in league with the poachers, if he doesn't poach himself; and the first opportunity I get of laying my finger upon him, out he goes.""  A few days later when Kate Ellison issued from the gate of the house, which lay just at the end of the village, with the basket containing some jelly and medicine for a sick child, she found Reuben Whitney awaiting her. He touched his cap.  ""Please, miss, I made bold to come here, to thank you for having cleared me.""  ""But I couldn't help clearing you, Reuben, for you see, I knew it wasn't you.""  ""Well, miss, it was very kind, all the same; and I am very much obliged to you.""  ""But why do you get into scrapes?"" the girl said. ""If you didn't, you wouldn't be suspected of other things. Mamma said, the other day, you got into more scrapes than any boy in the village; and you look nice, too. Why do you do it?""  ""I don't know why I do it, miss,"" Reuben said shamefacedly. ""I suppose it's because I don't go into the fields, like most of the other boys; and haven't got much to do. But there's no great harm in them, miss. They are just larks, nothing worse.""  ""You don't do really bad things?"" the girl asked.  ""No, miss, I hope not.""  ""And you don't tell stories, do you?""  ""No, miss, never. If I do anything and I am asked, I always own it. I wouldn't tell a lie to save myself from a licking.""  ""That's right,"" the girl said graciously.  She caught somewhat of her mother's manner, from going about with her to the cottages; and it seemed quite natural, to her, to give her advice to this village scapegrace.  ""Well, try not to do these sort of things again, Reuben; because I like you, and I don't like to hear people say you are the worst boy in the village, and I don't think you are. Good-bye,"" and Kate Ellison proceeded on her way.  Reuben smiled as he looked after her. Owing to his memory of his former position at the mill, and to his mother's talk and teaching, Reuben did not entertain the same feeling of respect, mingled with fear, for the squire's family which was felt by the village in general. Instead of being two years younger than himself, the girl had spoken as gravely as if she had been twenty years his senior, and Reuben could not help a smile of amusement.  ""She is a dear little lady,"" he said, as he looked after her; ""and it's only natural she should talk like her mother. But Mrs. Ellison means well, too, mother says; and as for the squire, he is a good fellow. I expected he would have given it to me the other day.  ""Well, now I will go up to the pony. One more lesson, and I think a baby might ride it.""  As he walked along, he met Tom Thorne. There had been war between them, since the affair of the broken window. Reuben had shown the other no animosity on the subject as, having been cleared, he had felt in no way aggrieved; but Tom Thorne was very sore over it. In the first place, he had been found out; and although Reuben himself had said nothing to him, respecting his conduct in allowing him to be flogged for the offence which he himself had committed, others had not been so reticent, and he had had a hard time of it in the village. Secondly, he had been severely thrashed by his father, in the presence of the squire; the former laying on the lash with a vigour which satisfied Mr. Ellison, the heartiness of the thrashing being due, not to any indignation at the fault, but because the boy's conduct had excited the squire's anger; which Thorne, for many reasons, was anxious to deprecate. He was his landlord, and had the power to turn him out at a quarter's notice; and as there was no possibility of obtaining any other house near, and he was doing by no means a bad trade, he was anxious to keep on good terms with him.  Tom Thorne was sitting on a gate, as Reuben passed.  ""You think you be a fine fellow, Reuben, but I will be even with you, some day.""  ""You can be even with me now,"" Reuben said, ""if you like to get off that gate.""  ""I bain't afeared of you, Reuben, don't you go to think it; only I ain't going to do any fighting now. Feyther says if I get into any more rows, he will pay me out; so I can't lick you now, but some day I will be even with you.""  ""That's a good excuse,"" Reuben said scornfully. ""However, I don't want to fight if you don't, only you keep your tongue to yourself. I don't want to say nothing to you, if you don't say nothing to me. You played me a dirty trick the other day, and you got well larrupped for it, so I don't owe you any grudge; but mind you, I don't want any more talk about your getting even with me, for if you do give me any more of it I will fetch you one on the nose, and then you will have a chance of getting even, at once.""  Tom Thorne held his tongue, only relieving his feelings by making a grimace after Reuben, as the latter passed on. In the various contests among the boys of the village, Reuben had proved himself so tough an adversary that, although Tom Thorne was heavier and bigger, he did not care about entering upon what would be, at best, a doubtful contest with him.  Contenting himself, therefore, with another muttered, ""I will be even with you some day,"" he strolled home to his father's ale house.  The change at the school was very speedily made. The squire generally carried out his resolutions while they were hot and, on the very day after his conversation with his wife on the subject, he went first to the vicar and arranged for the retirement of the clerk, and the instalment of White in his place; and then went to the school house, and informed the master of his intention. The latter had been expecting his dismissal, since Mrs. Ellison had spoken to him on the previous day; and the news which the squire gave him was a relief to him. His emoluments, as clerk, would be smaller than those he received as schoolmaster; but while he would not be able to discharge the duties of the latter for very much longer, for he felt the boys were getting too much for him, he would be able to perform the very easy work entailed by the clerkship for many years to come. It was, too, a position not without dignity; and indeed, in the eyes of the village the clerk was a personage of far greater importance than the schoolmaster. He therefore thankfully accepted the offer, and agreed to give up the school as soon as a substitute could be found.  In those days anyone was considered good enough for a village schoolmaster, and the post was generally filled by men who had failed as tradesmen, and in everything else they put their hands to; and whose sole qualification for the office was that they were able to read and write. Instead of advertising, however, in the county paper, the squire wrote to an old college friend, who was now in charge of a London parish, and asked him to choose a man for the post.  ""I don't want a chap who will cram all sorts of new notions into the heads of the children,"" the squire said. ""I don't think it would do them any good, or fit them any better for their stations. The boys have got to be farm labourers, and the girls to be their wives; and if they can read really well, and write fairly, it's about as much as they want in the way of learning; but I think that a really earnest sort of man might do them good, otherwise. A schoolmaster, in my mind, should be the clergyman's best assistant. I don't know, my dear fellow, that I can explain in words more exactly what I mean; but I think you will understand me, and will send down the sort of man I want.  ""The cottage is a comfortable one, there's a good bit of garden attached to it, and I don't mind paying a few shillings a week more than I do now, to get the sort of man I want. If he has a wife so much the better. She might teach the girls to sew, which would be, to nine out of ten, a deal more use than reading and writing; and if she could use her needle, and make up dresses and that sort of thing, she might add to their income. Not one woman in five in the village can make her own clothes, and they have to go to a place three miles away to get them done.""  A week later the squire received an answer from his friend, saying that he had chosen a man, and his wife, whom he thought would suit.  ""The poor fellow was rather a cripple,"" he said. ""He is a wood engraver by trade, but he fell downstairs and hurt his back. The doctor who attended him at the hospital spoke to me about him. He said that he might, under favourable circumstances, get better in time; but that he was delicate, and absolutely needed change of air and a country life. I have seen him several times, and have been much struck with his intelligence. He has been much depressed at being forbidden to work, but has cheered up greatly since I told him of your offer. I have no doubt he will do well.  ""I have selected him, not only for that reason, but because his wife is as suitable as he is. She is an admirable young woman, and was a dressmaker before he married her. She has supported them both ever since he was hurt, months ago. She is delighted at the idea of the change for, although the money will be very much less than he earned at his trade, she has always been afraid of his health giving way; and is convinced that fresh air, and the garden you speak of, will put new life into him.""  The squire was not quite satisfied with the letter; but, as he told himself, he could not expect to get a man trained specially as a schoolmaster to accept the post; and at any rate, if the man was not satisfactory his wife was likely to be so. He accordingly ordered his groom to take the light cart and drive over to Lewes, the next day, to meet the coach when it came in; and to bring over the new schoolmaster, his wife, and their belongings.  Mrs. Ellison at once went down to the village, and got a woman to scrub the cottage from top to bottom, and put everything tidy. The furniture went with the house, and had been provided by the squire. Mrs. Ellison went over it, and ordered a few more things to be sent down from the house to make it more comfortable for a married couple and, driving over to Lewes, ordered a carpet, curtains, and a few other little comforts for it.  James Shrewsbury was, upon his arrival, much pleased with his cottage, which contrasted strongly with the room in a crowded street which he had occupied in London; and his wife was still more pleased.  ""I am sure we shall be happy and comfortable here, James,"" she said, ""and the air feels so fresh and pure that I am convinced you will soon get strong and well again. What is money to health? I am sure I shall be ten times as happy, here, as I was when you were earning three or four times as much, in London.""  The squire and Mrs. Ellison came down the next morning, at the opening of the school; and after a chat with the new schoolmaster and his wife, the squire accompanied the former into the school room.  ""Look here, boys and girls,"" he said, ""Mr. Shrewsbury has come down from London to teach you. He has been ill, and is not very strong. I hope you will give him no trouble, and I can tell you it will be the worse for you, if you do. I am going to look into matters myself; and I shall have a report sent me in, regularly, as to how each of you is getting on, with a special remark as to conduct; and I can tell you, if any of you are troublesome you will find me down at your father's, in no time.""  The squire's words had considerable effect, and an unusual quiet reigned in the school, after he had left and the new schoolmaster opened a book.  They soon found that his method of teaching was very different to that which they were accustomed to. There was no shouting or thumping on the desk with the cane, no pulling of ears or cuffing of heads. Everything was explained quietly and clearly; and when they went out of the school, all agreed that the new master was a great improvement on Master White, while the master himself reported to his wife that he had got on better than he had expected.    Chapter 2: The Poisoned Dog.   The boys soon felt that Mr. Shrewsbury really wished to teach them, and that he was ready to assist those who wanted to get on. In the afternoon the schoolmaster's wife started a sewing class for the girls and, a week or two after he came, the master announced that such of the elder class of boys and girls who chose to come, in the evening, to his cottage could do so for an hour; and that he and the boys would read, by turns, some amusing book while the girls worked. Only Reuben Whitney and two or three others at first availed themselves of the invitation, but these spoke so highly of their evening that the number soon increased. Three quarters of an hour were spent in reading some interesting work of travel or adventure, and then the time was occupied in talking over what they had read, and in explaining anything which they did not understand; and as the evenings were now long and dark, the visits to the schoolmaster soon came to be regarded as a privilege, and proved an incentive to work to those in the lower classes, only those in the first place being admitted to them.  Reuben worked hard all through the winter, and made very rapid progress; the schoolmaster, seeing how eager he was to get on, doing everything in his power to help him forward, and lending him books to study at home. One morning in the spring, the squire looked in at Mrs. Whitney's shop.  ""Mrs. Whitney,"" he said, ""I don't know what you are thinking of doing with that boy of yours. Mr. Shrewsbury gives me an excellent account of him, and says that he is far and away the cleverest and most studious of the boys. I like the lad, and owe him a good turn for having broken in that pony for my daughter; besides, for his father's sake I should like to help him on. Now, in the first place, what are you thinking of doing with him?""  ""I am sure I am very much obliged to you,"" Mrs. Whitney said. ""I was thinking, when he gets a little older, of apprenticing him to some trade, but he is not fourteen yet.""  ""The best thing you can do, Mrs. Whitney. Let it be some good trade, where he can use his wits--not a butcher, a baker, or a tailor, or anything of that sort. I should say an upholsterer, or a mill wright, or some trade where his intelligence can help him on. When the time comes I shall be glad to pay his apprentice fees for him, and perhaps, when you tell me what line he has chosen, a word from me to one of the tradesmen in Lewes may be a help. In the meantime, that is not what I have specially come about. Young Finch, who looks to my garden, is going to leave; and if you like, your boy can have the place. My gardener knows his business thoroughly, and the boy can learn under him. I will pay him five shillings a week. It will break him into work a little, and he is getting rather old for the school now. I have spoken to Shrewsbury, and he says that, if the boy is disposed to go on studying in the evening, he will direct his work and help him on.""  ""Thank you kindly, sir,"" Mrs. Whitney said. ""I think it will just be the thing, for a year or so, before he is apprenticed. He was saying only last night that he was the biggest boy in the school; and though I know he likes learning, he would like to be helping me, and feels somehow that it isn't right that he should be going on schooling, while all the other boys at his age are doing something. Not that I want him to earn money, for the shop keeps us both; but it's what he thinks about it.""  ""That's natural enough, Mrs. Whitney, and anything the boy earns with me, you see, you can put by, and it will come in useful to him some day.""  Reuben was glad when he heard of the arrangement; for although, as his mother had said, he was fond of school, he yet felt it as a sort of reproach that, while others of his age were earning money, he should be doing nothing. He accepted the offer of the schoolmaster to continue to work at his studies in the evening, and in a week he was installed in Tom Finch's place.  The arrangement was not the squire's original idea, but that of his younger daughter, who felt a sort of proprietary interest in Reuben; partly because her evidence had cleared him of the accusation of breaking the windows, partly because he had broken in the pony for her; so when she heard that the boy was leaving, she had at once asked her father that Reuben should take his place.  ""I think he is a good boy, papa,"" she said; ""and if he was clever enough to break in my pony, I am sure he will be clever enough to wheel the wheelbarrow and pull weeds.""  ""I should think he would, lassie,"" her father said, laughing, ""although it does not exactly follow. Still, if you guarantee that he is a good boy, I will see about it.""  ""Mamma doesn't think he is a very good boy,"" Kate said; ""but you see, papa, mamma is a woman, and perhaps she doesn't understand boys and girls as well as I do. I think he's good, and he told me he never told stories.""  The squire laughed.  ""I don't know what your mamma would say to that, puss; nor whether she would agree that you understand boys and girls better than she does. However, I will take your opinion this time, and give Reuben a chance.""  The subject was not mentioned again in Kate's hearing, but she was greatly pleased, one morning, at seeing Reuben at work in the gardens.  ""Good morning, Reuben,"" she said.  ""Good morning, miss,"" he replied, touching his hat.  ""I am glad you have come in Tom's place, and I hope you will be good, and not get into scrapes, for I told papa I thought you would not; and you see, if you do, he will turn round and blame me.""  ""I will try not to get into scrapes, Miss Kate,"" Reuben said. ""I don't do it often, you know, and I don't think there will be much chance of it, here.""  Kate nodded and walked on, and Reuben went about his work.  There was, however, much more opportunity for getting into scrapes than Reuben imagined, although the scrapes were not of the kind he had pictured. Being naturally careless, he had not been there a week before, in his eagerness to get home to a particularly interesting book, he forgot to carry out his orders to shut the cucumber frames and, a sharp frost coming on in the night, the plants were all killed; to the immense indignation of the gardener, who reported the fact, with a very serious face, to the squire.  ""I am afraid that boy will never do, squire. Such carelessness I never did see, and them plants was going on beautifully.""  ""Confound the young rascal!"" the squire said wrathfully, for he was fond of cucumbers. ""I will speak to him myself. This sort of thing will never do.""  And accordingly, the squire spoke somewhat sharply to Reuben, who was really sorry for the damage his carelessness had caused; and he not only promised the squire that it should not occur again, but mentally resolved very firmly that it should not. He felt very shamefaced when Kate passed him in the garden, with a serious shake of her head, signifying that she was shocked that he had thus early got into a scrape, and discredited her recommendation.  The lesson was a useful one. Henceforth Reuben paid closer attention to his work, and even the gardener, who regarded boys as his great trial in life, expressed himself satisfied with him.  ""Since that affair of the cucumbers I must own, squire,"" he said a month later, ""that he is the best boy I have come across. He attends to what I say and remembers it, and I find I can trust him to do jobs that I have never been able to trust boys with, before. He seems to take an interest in it, and as he is well spoken and civil, he ought to get on and make a good gardener, in time.""  ""I am glad to hear a good account of him,"" the squire replied. ""He is sharp and intelligent, and will make his way in life, or I am mistaken. His father was an uncommonly clever fellow, though he made a mess of it, just at the end; and I think the boy takes after him.""  Among Reuben's other duties was that of feeding and attending to the dogs. These consisted of two setters, a pointer, and a large house dog, who was chained up at the entrance to the stables. Reuben was soon excellent friends with the sporting dogs, but the watchdog, who had probably been teased by Reuben's predecessor, always growled and showed his teeth when he went near him; and Reuben never dared venture within the length of his chain, but pushed the bowl containing his food just within his reach.  One day, he had been sent on an errand to the stables. He forgot the dog and ran close to the kennel. The animal at once sprang out. Reuben made a rush, but he was not quick enough, and the dog caught him by the leg. Reuben shouted, and the coachman ran out and, seizing a fork, struck the dog and compelled him to loose his hold.  ""Has he bit you badly, Reuben?""  ""Well, he has bit precious hard,"" Reuben replied. ""I think he has nearly taken a piece out of my calf,"" as, on pulling up his trousers, he showed his leg streaming with blood.  ""Put it under the pump, lad. I will pump on it,"" the coachman said. ""He's a bad-tempered brute, and I wonder the squire keeps it.""  ""The brute ought to be killed,"" Reuben grumbled angrily. ""I have never teased it or worried it, in any way. I wish you had stuck that fork into him, instead of hitting him with it. If you hadn't been within reach, he would have taken the bit out of me. He will kill somebody some day, and it were best to kill him, first.""  The gardener pumped for some time on Reuben's leg; and then, going into the kitchen, he got some strips of rag from the cook and bound it up.  ""You had best go home now,"" he said. ""I will tell the gardener, when he comes round, what has happened to you. I doubt you will have to lay up, for a day or two.""  As Reuben limped home, he met Tom Thorne walking with another boy.  ""Hello, Reuben!"" the latter exclaimed. ""What's come to you? Yer trousers bee all tore.""  ""That brute of a house dog at the squire's has had hold of me,"" Reuben answered. ""The savage beast has had a try, a good many times; but this time he got hold, and he has bit me pretty sharp.""  Reuben had to keep his leg quiet for three days but, the third evening, he was well enough to go down the village to the schoolhouse. After the lesson was over he walked for some distance up the road, for his leg was very stiff; and he thought it would be a good thing to try and walk it off, as he intended to go to work next morning. On getting up early in the morning, however, he found it was still stiff and sore; but he thought he had better go and try to work for a bit.  ""I am glad you are back again,"" the gardener said, when he saw him, ""for there's a lot of work on hand; but I see you are still lame. The coachman tells me it were a nasty bite.""  ""It's pretty sore still,"" Reuben replied, ""and I don't think I can walk about much; but I thought I might help in some other way.""  ""Very well,"" the gardener said. ""There are a lot of plants which want shifting into larger pots. You do them, and I will take up the fork and dig up that piece of ground I want to put the young lettuces into.""  Reuben worked hard till half-past eight, and then went off to his breakfast. On his return, he was told the squire wished to speak to him.  ""It's about that dog, I expect,"" the gardener remarked. ""I suppose you know he were poisoned last night.""  ""No, I didn't know,"" Reuben replied; ""but it's a precious good job. I wish he had been poisoned before he got his teeth into me.""  Reuben, on going round to the back door, was shown into the library, where the squire was sitting. The coachman was with him.  ""Now then, Reuben,"" the squire said, ""I want you to tell me the truth about this matter. The coachman told me, three days ago, that you had been bitten by the yard dog, and I made up my mind to get rid of him, on the first opportunity; but I find he was poisoned, yesterday evening.""  He stopped as if expecting Reuben to say something; but the boy, having nothing to say, merely replied:  ""Yes, sir, so the gardener has told me.""  ""What do you know about it, Reuben?""  ""I don't know anything about it, sir,"" Reuben replied, opening his eyes.  ""Now, look here, lad,"" the squire said gravely, ""I am disposed to think well of you; and although I consider it a serious offence your poisoning the dog, I shall consider it very much worse if you deny it.""  ""But I didn't poison it, sir,"" Reuben affirmed. ""I never dreamt of such a thing.""  The squire set his lips hard together.  ""Just tell me your story over again,"" he said to the coachman.  ""Well, yesterday evening, squire, I went down into the village to buy some 'bacca. Just as I got back to the gate, out runs a boy. It was too dark for me to see his face, but I naturally supposed it were Reuben, so I said, 'Hello, Reuben, how's the leg?' But the moment I spoke, he turned off from the path and ran away.  ""Well, I thought it was queer, but I went on to the stable. About a quarter of an hour afterwards, and as I was a-cleaning up the bits, I heard Wolf howl. He kept on at it, so I took a lantern and went out to see what was the matter. He was rolling about, and seemed very bad. I stood a-looking at him, wondering what were best to do, when sudden he gave a sort of yell, and rolled over, and he was dead. I thought it was no good telling you about it till this morning; and thinking it over, and seeing how sudden like it was, I come to the 'pinion as how he had been poisoned; and naturally thinking that, as he had bit Reuben, and as how Reuben said he ought to be killed, and seeing as I had met the boy a quarter an hour afore the dog was took bad, it came to me as how he had done it.  ""This morning I knew for certain as the dog had been poisoned, for just outside of the reach of his chain there was that piece of paper a-lying, as you have got before you.""  It was a piece of blue paper, about four inches square, on which was printed: ""Rat poison.""  ""You hear that, Reuben? What have you to say?"" the squire asked.  ""I have got nothing to say, sir,"" Reuben answered, ""except that whoever the boy was, it wasn't me, and that I know nothing about it.""  ""Well, Reuben, it will be easy for you to clear yourself, by saying where you were at the time.  ""What o'clock was it, Robert, that you saw the boy?""  ""It was just a quarter past eight, squire. The quarter struck just as I opened the gate.""  ""Were you out or at home at that hour, Reuben?""  ""I was out, sir. I went to the schoolmaster's.""  ""What time did you leave there?""  ""I left at eight, sir.""  ""Then if you got in just after eight, it is clear that you were not the boy,"" the squire said. ""If your mother tells me that you were in at five minutes past eight, that settles the question, as far as you are concerned.""  ""I didn't get in till half-past eight, sir,"" Reuben said. ""I walked about for a bit, after I came out from school, to try and get the stiffness out of my leg, so as to be able to come to work this morning.""  ""Was anyone with you, Reuben? Is there anyone to say what you did with yourself, between eight and half-past eight?""  ""No, sir,"" Reuben said quietly. ""I didn't speak to a soul; and didn't see a soul, so far as I know, from the time I came out of the gate of the schoolhouse till I got home.""  ""Does your mother sell packets of this poison?"" the squire said, pointing to the paper.  Reuben looked at the paper.  ""Yes, sir; I believe she does.""  ""Well, my lad,"" the squire said, ""you must acknowledge that the case looks very ugly against you. You are known to have borne bad feelings against the dog; naturally enough, I admit. A boy about your size was seen by Robert in the dark, coming out of the gate; and that he was there for no good purpose is proved by the fact that he ran away when spoken to. A quarter of an hour later, the dog dies of poison. That poison you certainly could get at home and, by your own admission, you were out and about at the time the dog was poisoned. The case looks very bad against you.""  ""I don't care how bad it looks,"" Reuben said, passionately. ""It wasn't me, squire, if that were the last word I ever had to speak.""  ""Very well,"" the squire said coldly. ""In my mind, the evidence is overwhelming against you. I have no intention of pursuing the matter further; nor will I, for your father's and mother's sake, bring public disgrace upon you; but of course I shall not retain you here further, nor have anything to do with you, in the future.""  Without a word, Reuben turned and left the room. Had he spoken, he would have burst into a passion of tears. With a white face, he walked through the village and entered his mother's shop.  ""What? Back again, Reuben?"" she said. ""I thought your leg was too bad to work.""  ""It isn't my leg, mother,"" he said, in a choking voice. ""The squire has dismissed me. He says I have poisoned his dog.""  ""Says you poisoned his dog, Reuben! Whatever put such an idea into his head?""  ""The coachman saw a boy coming out of the yard, at a quarter past eight last night. It was too dark for him to say for certain, but he thought it was me. A quarter of an hour later the dog died of poison, and this morning they picked up a cover of one of those rat powders you sell. I couldn't say where I was at a quarter past eight, when the coachman saw the boy; for as you know, mother, I told you I had walked out a bit, after I came out from the school, to get the stiffness out of my leg. So, altogether, the squire has made up his mind 'tis me, and so he has sent me away.""  Reuben had summed up the points against himself in a broken voice, and now broke into a passion of tears. His mother tried in vain to pacify him; but indeed her own indignation, at her boy being charged with such a thing, was so great that she could do little to console him.  ""It's shameful!"" she exclaimed, over and over again. ""I call it downright wicked of the squire to suspect you of such a thing.""  ""Well, mother, it does look very bad against me,"" Reuben said, wiping his eyes at last, ""and I don't know as the squire is so much to be blamed for suspecting me. I know and you know that it wasn't me; but there's no reason why the squire should know it. Somebody has poisoned his dog, and that somebody is a boy. He knows that I was unfriendly with the dog so, putting things together, I don't see as he could help suspecting me, and only my word the other way. It seems to me as if somebody must have done it to get me in a row, for I don't know that the dog had bit anyone else. If it is anyone, I expect it's Tom Thorne. He has never been friends with me, since that affair of the school window.""  ""I will go at once and speak to his father,"" Mrs. Whitney said, taking down her bonnet from the wall.  ""No, mother, you can't do that,"" Reuben exclaimed. ""We have got nothing against him. The squire has ten times as good reason to suspect me, as I have to suspect Tom Thorne; so as we know the squire's wrong, it's ten times as likely we shall be wrong. Besides, if he did it, of course he would deny it, he is the worst liar in the village; and then folks would say I wasn't satisfied with doing it myself, but I wanted to throw the blame on to him, just as he did on me before. No, it won't do, mother.""  Mrs. Whitney saw that it wouldn't do, and sat down again. Reuben sat thinking, for some time.  ""I must go away, mother,"" he said at last. ""I can't stop here. Every one in the village will get to know of it, and they will point at me as the boy as poisoned the squire's dog, and then lied about it. I couldn't stand that, mother.""  ""And you sha'n't stand it, my boy,"" Mrs. Whitney said, ""not a day. I will give up the cottage and move into Lewes, at once. I didn't go there before, for I am known there, and don't like folk to see how much I have come down in the world.""  ""No, mother, you stop here, and I will go up to London. They say there is lots of work there, and I suppose I can get on as well as another.""  ""I will not hear of your doing such a thing. I should never expect to hear of you again. I should always be thinking that you had got run over, or were starving in the streets, or dying in a workhouse. No, Reuben, my plan's best. It's just silliness my not liking to settle in Lewes; for of course it's better going where one is known, and I should be lost in a strange place. No; I daresay I shall find a cottage there, and I shall manage to get a living somehow--perhaps open a little shop like this, and then you can be apprenticed, and live at home.""  An hour later, Mrs. Ellison called. Reuben had gone upstairs to lie down, for his leg was very painful. Mrs. Whitney did not give her visitor time to begin.  ""I know what you have called about, Mrs. Ellison, and I don't want to talk about it with you. The squire has grievously wronged my boy. I wouldn't have believed it of him, but he's done it; so now, ma'm, I give a week's notice of this house, and here's my rent up to that time, and I will send you the key when I go. And now, ma'm, as I don't want any words about it, I think it will be better if you go, at once.""  Mrs. Ellison hesitated a moment. Never, from the time she entered the village as the squire's wife, had she been thus spoken to; but she saw at once, in Mrs. Whitney's face, that it were better not to reply to her; and that her authority as the squire's wife had, for once, altogether vanished. She therefore took up the money which Mrs. Whitney had laid on the counter and, without a word, left the shop.  ""I do believe, William,"" she said as, greatly ruffled and indignant, she gave an account of the interview to the squire, ""that the woman would have slapped my face, if I had said anything. She is the most insolent creature I ever met.""  ""Well, my dear,"" the squire said seriously, ""I can hardly wonder at the poor woman's indignation. She has had a hard time of it, and this must be a sad blow. Naturally she believes in her son's innocence, and we must not altogether blame her, if she resents his dismissal. It's a sad business altogether, and I know it will be a worry and trouble to me for months. Mind, I don't doubt that the boy did it; it does not seem possible that it should be otherwise. Still, it is not absolutely proved; and upon my word, I wish now I had said nothing at all about it. I like the boy, and I liked his father before him; and as this story must get about, it cannot but do him serious damage. Altogether it is a most tiresome business, and I would give a hundred pounds if it hadn't taken place.""  ""I really do not see why you should worry about it, William. The boy has always been a troublesome boy, and perhaps this lesson may do him good.""  The squire did not attempt to argue the question. He felt really annoyed and put out and, after wandering over the ground and stables, he went down to the schoolhouse after the children had been dismissed.  ""Have you heard, Shrewsbury, about that boy Whitney?""  ""No, sir, I have heard nothing about him,"" the schoolmaster said. ""He was here yesterday evening, as usual. His leg is no worse, I hope. Those dog bites are always nasty things.""  ""I wish it had been worse,"" the squire said testily; ""then he would have been laid up quietly at home, instead of being about mischief.""  ""Why, what has he done, sir?"" the schoolmaster asked, in surprise.  The squire related the history of the dog's death, and of his interview with Reuben. The schoolmaster looked serious, and grieved.  ""What do you think of the matter, Shrewsbury?"" the squire asked, when he had finished.  ""I would rather not give any opinion,"" the schoolmaster replied quietly.  ""That means you think I am wrong,"" the squire said quickly. ""Well, say it out, man; you won't offend me. I am half inclined to think I was wrong, myself; and I would as lief be told so, as not.""  ""I don't say you are wrong, sir,"" the schoolmaster said, ""except that I think you assumed the boy's guilt too much as a matter of course. Now, I have seen a great deal of him. I have a great liking for him, and believe him to be not only a singularly intelligent and hard-working lad, but a perfectly truthful and open one. I allow that the circumstances are much against him; but the evidence is, to my mind, completely overbalanced by his absolute denial. You must remember that he saw that you were quite convinced of his guilt; and that, in your eyes, his denial would be an aggravation of the offence. Therefore you see he had no strong motive for telling a lie.  ""Who killed your dog I do not know but, from my knowledge of his character and assurance of his truthfulness, I am perfectly convinced that Reuben Whitney did not do it. The boy is, in some ways, very superior to the other lads I teach. I hear that his father was in a good position, as a miller; and his mother is of a different class, altogether, to the other women of the village. The boy has a certain refinement about him, a thoughtfulness and consideration which set him apart from the others. Mischievous and somewhat inclined to be noisy as he generally is, on days when I have not felt quite equal to my work he would notice it at once and, without saying a word, would, by his quietness and attention to his work, try to save me trouble; and I have heard him try to quiet the others, as they trooped out. The boy has a good heart as well as a good intellect, and nothing save his own confession would make me believe that he poisoned your dog.""  ""But he said he wished it was killed,"" the squire urged, as in defence of his own opinion.  ""He said so, squire, at the time he was smarting with the pain of a severe bite; and I think probably he meant no more than a man who, under the same circumstances, would say, 'Confound the dog!' or even a stronger oath.""  Mr. Ellison was silenced, for when in wrath he was, himself, given to use strong expressions.  ""I don't know what to say, Shrewsbury,"" he said at last. ""I am afraid I have made a mess of it; but certainly, as I first heard it, the case seemed to admit of no doubt. 'Pon my word, I don't know what to do. My wife has just been up to see Mrs. Whitney, and the woman blazed out at her, and wouldn't let her say a word, but gave notice that she should give up the house at the end of the week. If it hadn't been for that, I might have done something; but Mrs. Ellison was very much aggrieved at her manner. Altogether, it's one of the most annoying things I ever had to do with.""  In the evening the schoolmaster put on his hat and went up, with his wife, to Mrs. Whitney. The women had seen a good deal of each other, as they both stood somewhat apart from the rest of the village and, in thought and speech, differed widely from the labourers' wives; and on evenings when the sewing class did not meet, the schoolmaster's wife often went up for an hour or two to Mrs. Whitney's, or the latter came down to the Shrewsburys' cottage.  ""We have come up, Mrs. Whitney,"" the schoolmaster said as they entered, ""to tell you how sorry we are to hear that you are going to leave, and that we are still more sorry for the cause. Of course, neither my wife nor myself believe for a moment that Reuben poisoned the squire's dog. The idea is preposterous. I told the squire as much, today.""  Mrs. Whitney burst into tears. She had kept up all day, sustained partly by indignation, and partly by the desire that Reuben should not see that she felt it; but the thought that all the village would believe Reuben guilty had cut her to the heart, and she had felt so unwilling to face anyone that, as soon as Mrs. Ellison had left, she had closed the shutters of her little shop; but she broke down, now, from her relief at hearing that someone besides herself believed the boy to be innocent.  ""I don't know what I shall do without you, Mrs. Whitney,"" Mrs. Shrewsbury said, when the widow recovered her composure. ""I shall miss you dreadfully. Is it quite settled that you will go?""  ""Quite settled, Mrs. Shrewsbury. I wouldn't stop in the squire's house for an hour longer than I could help, after his believing Reuben to be guilty of poisoning his dog, and not believing the boy when he said he had nothing to do with it. He ought to have known my boy better than that. And he coming up only the other day, and pretending he felt a kindness for my dead husband.""  ""I think the squire was too hasty, Mrs. Whitney,"" the schoolmaster said. ""But you see, he did not know Reuben as we do; and I think, if you will excuse my saying so, you have been a little hasty, too. The squire came in to me to tell me about it, and I could see he was not satisfied in his mind, even before I gave him my positive opinion that Reuben was innocent; and I do think that, if you had not given Mrs. Ellison notice so sharply, the squire would have taken back his words; and said that at any rate, as there was nothing absolutely proved, he would hold his judgment in suspense until the matter was cleared up.""  ""And having everyone pointing the finger at my boy in the meantime! No, thank you, Mr. Shrewsbury, that would not do for me. I was not a bit hasty. Mrs. Ellison came in here prepared to talk to me about Reuben's wickedness; I saw it in her face, so I wouldn't let her open her lips. If she had, I should have given her a piece of my mind that she wouldn't have forgot, in a hurry.""  ""I can quite understand your feelings, Mrs. Whitney,"" the schoolmaster said, ""and I have no doubt I should have acted as you did, if a son of mine had been suspected in the same way. Still, I think it's a pity; for if Reuben had stayed here, there would have been more chance of the matter being cleared up. However, we won't talk about that now. Now tell me, what are your plans?""  Mrs. Whitney told her visitors what she had determined upon. As Lewes was only four miles off, the schoolmaster said that he and his wife would sometimes come over to see her; and that he hoped that Reuben, whatever trade he was apprenticed to, would still go on with his studies. He would give him any advice or assistance in his power.  The next day Mrs. Whitney and Reuben moved, with all their belongings, to Lewes.    Chapter 3: The Burglary At The Squire's.   ""What is that woman Whitney going to do with her boy?"" the squire asked the schoolmaster, when he happened to meet him in the village about a month after she had left. ""Have you heard?""  ""Nothing is settled yet, sir. My wife had a letter from her, two or three days ago, saying that she had been disappointed in getting Penfold the mill wright to take him. He wanted fifty pounds premium, and she could only afford to pay twenty, so she is looking out for something else. You have heard nothing more that would throw any light on that affair, squire?""  ""No, and don't suppose I ever shall. Have you any opinion about it?""  ""My opinion is that of Reuben, himself,"" the schoolmaster said. ""He believes that someone did it who had a grudge against him, on purpose, to throw suspicion on him.""  ""Who should have a grudge against him?"" the squire asked.  ""Well, squire, there was one boy in the village who had, rightly or wrongly, a grudge against Reuben. That is Tom Thorne. Reuben has not a shadow of evidence that it was this boy, but the lad has certainly been his enemy ever since that affair of breaking the windows of the school, just before I came here. Thorne, you know, did it, but allowed Reuben to be punished for the offence; and the truth would never have been known had it not been, as I heard, that your daughter happened to see the stone thrown. Since that time there has been bad blood between the boys. I do not for a moment say that Thorne poisoned your dog. Still, the boys are near enough of a size for one to be mistaken for the other in the dark; and Thorne knew that Reuben had been bitten by the dog, for Reuben spoke to another boy about it, that afternoon, while Thorne was standing by. Of course, this is but the vaguest suspicion. Still, if you ask my opinion, I should say that I consider, from what I have heard of the character of Tom Thorne, that he would be much more likely to poison the dog, in order to get Reuben into disgrace, than Reuben would be to do so out of revenge because the dog had bitten him.""  The squire took off his hat, and passed his hands through his hair, in perplexity.  ""I don't know what to think, Shrewsbury,"" he said. ""It may be as you say. I look upon Thorne as the worst character in the village, and likely enough his son may take after him. That ale house of his is the resort of all the idle fellows about. I have strong reason to believe he is in alliance with the poachers. The first time I get a chance, out he goes. I have only been waiting, for some time, for an opportunity. I can't very well turn him out of his house without some excuse.  ""What did you say was the name of the mill wright at Lewes Mrs. Whitney was wanting to get her son with?""  The schoolmaster repeated the name, which the squire jotted down in a notebook.  ""Look here, Shrewsbury,"" he said, ""don't you mention to Mrs. Whitney that you spoke to me about this matter. Do you understand?""  ""I understand, sir,"" the schoolmaster said.  And he was not surprised when, a few days afterwards, his wife received a letter from Mrs. Whitney, saying that Mr. Penfold had come in to say that he had changed his mind, and that he would take Reuben as his apprentice for twenty pounds; adding, to her surprise, that he should give him half a crown a week for the first year, and gradually raise his pay, as he considered that boys ought to be able to earn a little money for themselves.  Reuben, therefore, was going to work on the following week. The half a crown a week which he was to earn was an important matter for his mother. For although she had found a cottage and opened a little shop, as before, her receipts were extremely small, and she had already begun to fear that she should be obliged to make another move, Lewes being too well supplied with shops for a small concern like hers to flourish. The half crown a week, however, would pay her rent; and she expected that she should make, at any rate, enough to provide food for herself and Reuben.  Mrs. Whitney had hoped that, although Lewes was but four miles from the village, the story about the dog would not travel so far; for it was not often that anyone from the village went over to the town. In this, however, she was mistaken for, a week after Reuben had gone to work, the foreman went to his master and said:  ""I don't know whether you are aware, Mr. Penfold, about that new boy; but I hear that he had to leave Tipping, where he was employed by Squire Ellison, for poisoning the squire's dog.""  ""How did you hear it?"" Mr. Penfold asked.  ""William Jenkins heard it from a man named Thorne, who belongs to the village, and whom he met at a public house, yesterday.""  ""William Jenkins had best not spend so much time in public houses,"" Mr. Penfold said shortly. ""I heard the story before I saw the boy and, from what I hear, I believe he was wrongfully accused. Just tell Jenkins that; and say that if I hear of him, or any of the hands, throwing the thing up in the boy's face, I will dismiss them instantly.""  And so Reuben did not know, till long after, that the story of the killing of the dog was known to anyone at Lewes.  For three years he worked in Mr. Penfold's yard, giving much satisfaction to his employer by his steadiness and handiness. He continued his studies of an evening, under the advice of his former master; who came over with his wife, three or four times each year, to spend a day with Mrs. Whitney. Reuben was now receiving ten shillings a week and, although the receipts of the shop failed, he and his mother were able to live in considerable comfort.  One day, about three years after coming to Lewes, he was returning to work after dinner when, as he passed a carriage standing in front of one of the shops, he heard his name pronounced, and the colour flushed to his cheek as, looking up, he saw Kate Ellison. Timidly he touched his cap, and would have hurried on, but the girl called to him.  ""Stop a minute, Reuben. I want to speak to you. I am glad I have met you. I have looked for you, every time I have come to Lewes. I wanted to tell you that I am sure you did not kill Wolf. I know you wouldn't have done it. Besides, you know, you told me that you never told stories; so when I heard that you said you didn't, I was quite sure about it.""  ""Thank you, miss,"" Reuben said gratefully. ""I did not kill the dog. I should never have thought of such a thing, though every one seemed against me.""  ""Not every one, Reuben. I didn't think so; and papa has told me, since, that he did not think so, and that he was afraid that he had made a mistake.""  ""I am glad to hear that, miss,"" Reuben said. ""The squire had been very kind to me, and it has always grieved me, very much, that he should think me capable of such a thing. I felt angry at the time, but I have not felt angry since I have thought it over quietly; for the case seems so strong against me that I don't see how the squire could have thought otherwise.  ""Thank you, miss. I sha'n't forget your kindness,"" and Reuben went on with a light heart, just as Mrs. Ellison and her elder daughter came out from the shop.  ""Who were you speaking to, Kate?"" she asked, as she took her seat in the carriage.  ""I was talking to Reuben Whitney, mamma. He was passing, so I called him to tell him that I did not believe he had killed Wolf.""  ""Then it was very improper behaviour on your part, Kate,"" her mother said angrily, for she had never quite recovered from the shock Mrs. Whitney had given to her dignity. ""You know my opinion on the subject. I have told you before that it is one I do not care to have discussed, and that I consider it very improper for a girl, of your age, to hold opinions different to those of your elders. I have no doubt, whatever, that boy poisoned the dog. I must beg of you that you will never speak to him again.""  Kate leaned back in the carriage with a little sigh. She could not understand why her mother, who was so kind to all the village people, should be so implacable on this subject. But Kate, who was now between fourteen and fifteen, knew that when her mother had taken up certain opinions they were not to be shaken; and that her father himself always avoided argument, on points on which he differed from her. Talking alone with his daughter the squire had, in answer to her sturdy assertion of Reuben's innocence, owned to her that he himself had his doubts on the subject, and that he was sorry he had dismissed the boy from his service; but she had never heard him do more than utter a protest, against Reuben's guilt being held as being absolutely proved, when her mother spoke of his delinquency.  But Kate was not one to desert a protege and, having been the means of Reuben's introduction to her father's, she had always regarded herself as his natural protector; and Mrs. Ellison would not have been pleased, had she known that her daughter had seldom met the schoolmaster without inquiring if he had heard how Reuben was getting on. She had even asked Mr. Shrewsbury to assure him of her belief in his innocence, which had been done; but she had resolved that, should she ever meet him, she would herself tell him so, even at the risk of her mother's displeasure.  Another year passed. Reuben was now seventeen, and was a tall, powerfully-built young fellow. During these four years he had never been over to Tipping, in the daytime; but had occasionally walked over, after dark, to visit the Shrewsburys, always going on special invitation, when he knew that no one else would be there. The Thornes no longer occupied the little public house. Tom Thorne had, a year before, been captured with two other poachers in the squire's woods, and had had six months' hard labour; and his father had at once been ejected from his house, and had disappeared from that part of the country. Reuben was glad that they had left; for he had long before heard that Thorne had spread the story, in Lewes, of the poisoning of the dog. He felt, however, with their departure all chance of his ever being righted in that matter was at an end.  One evening in winter, when Reuben had done his work, he said to his mother:  ""I shall go over and see Mr. Shrewsbury tonight. I have not been over for some time and, as it is not his night for a class, I am pretty sure not to find anyone there. I told him, when I was there last, that I would take over a few tools and fix up those shelves for him.  ""I don't suppose he will stay very much longer at Tipping. His health is completely restored now, and even his wife admits that he could work at his own business again. He has already been doing a little, for some of the houses he worked for in town, so as to get his connection back again. I expect, every time I see him, to hear that he has made up his mind to go. He would have done it, two years back; but his wife and the two little ones are so well that he did not like the thought of taking them up to London, till he was sure that his health was strong enough to stand steady work. I shall miss them very much. He has been a good friend, indeed, to me.""  ""He has indeed,"" Mrs. Whitney said. ""I think anyhow, Reuben, you would have got on at your trade; but you would never have been what you are now, if it hadn't been for him. Your poor father would be proud of you, if he could see you; and I am sure that, when you take off that workman's suit and put on your Sunday clothes, you look as well as if the mill had never gone wrong, and you had been brought up as he intended you to be. Mrs. Tyler was saying only the other day that you looked quite the gentleman, and lots of people have said the same.""  ""Nonsense, mother,"" Reuben answered, ""there is nothing of the gentleman about me. Of course, people say things that they think will please you, knowing that you regard me as a sort of wonder. I hope I shall make my way some day, and the fact that I have had a better education than most young fellows, in my position of life, of course may make some little difference; and will, I hope, help me to mount the ladder, when once I put my foot upon it.""  But although, no doubt, Mrs. Whitney was a partial judge, her opinion as to her son was not an incorrect one; for with his intelligent face, and quiet self-assured bearing, he looked very much more like a gentleman than many young fellows in a far better position in life.  The stars were shining brightly when he started, at seven o'clock in the evening; and he walked with a brisk step, until he arrived within half a mile of the village. As he passed by the end of a lane which ran into the road, he heard a horse impatiently pawing the ground; the sound being followed by a savage oath, to the animal, to stand quiet. Reuben walked on a few steps, and then paused. The lane, as he knew, only led to some fields a short distance away. What could a horse be doing there? And who could be the man who spoke to it? There had, lately, been several burglaries on lonely houses, in that part of the country; and the general belief was that these had been perpetrated by men from London.  ""I daresay it's nothing,"" Reuben said to himself. ""Still, it is certainly curious and, at any rate, there can be no harm in having a look.""  Walking upon the grass at the side of the road, he retraced his steps to the end of the lane, and then stood and listened. He heard a murmur of voices, and determined to follow the matter up. He walked quietly down the lane. After going about a hundred yards, he saw something dark in the road and, approaching it very cautiously, found that it was a horse harnessed to a gig. As he was standing wondering what to do next he started, for the silence was broken by some voices near him.  ""It was a stupid thing to get here so early, and to have to wait about for four hours in this ditch.""  ""It was the best plan though,"" another voice replied. ""The trap might have been noticed, if we had been driving about the roads after dark; while in the daylight no one would give it a second thought.""  ""That's right enough,"" the first speaker said, ""but it's precious cold here. Hand me that flask again. I am blest if the wind does not come through the hedge like a knife.""  The voices came from the other side of the hedge, on the opposite side of the lane. Reuben crossed noiselessly. There was a gate just where the cart had stopped, and the men had evidently got over it, to obtain the shelter of the hedge from the wind. Reuben felt the gate, which was old and rickety; then cautiously he placed his feet on the lower bar, and leaned forward so as to look round the hedge.  ""What time are the others to be here, Tom?""  ""They said they would be here at nine o'clock. We passed them about six miles on the road, so they ought to be here to time.""  ""I suppose there's no doubt about this here being a good business?""  ""I will answer for that,"" the other said. ""I don't suppose as there's much money in the house, but there's no end of silver plate, and their watches, and plenty of sparklers. I have heard say as there's no one in the county as has more jewels than the squire's wife.""  ""You know the house well, don't you?""  ""I never was inside,"" the other said, ""but I have heard enough, from them that has, to know where the rooms lie. The plate chest is in the butler's pantry and, as we are going to get in by the kitchen window, we are safe to be able to clear that out without being heard. I shall go on, directly the others come, and chuck this meat to the dogs--that will silence them. I know the way there, for I tried that on once before.""  Reuben had thought that the voice was familiar to him, and the words gave him the clue--the speaker was Tom Thorne--and he, and those with him, were going to commit a burglary at the squire's. He was hesitating whether to make off at once, to warn the squire of what was intended; or to listen and learn a little more of their plan, when suddenly a light shone behind him, and a voice exclaimed with an oath:  ""Who have we here?""  He leapt down, and was in the act of turning round to defend himself, when a heavy blow with a cudgel struck him on the head, and felled him insensible to the ground. While he had been listening to the conversation, two men had come quietly up the lane, walking on the grass as he had done; and their footsteps had been unheard by him, for the horse continued, at times, impatiently to paw the ground. The sound of their comrades' voices had told them where they were sitting and, turning on a bull's-eye lantern to show them the gate, they had seen Reuben leaning over it, in the act of listening.  When Reuben recovered consciousness, he found that he was lying in the ditch, his hands tightly bound to his sides, and a handkerchief stuffed into his mouth. The four men were gathered close by, talking in low tones.  ""I ain't going to give up the job, now we come so far to do it,"" one said, with an oath. ""Besides, it's not only the swag, but the grudge I owe the squire. If I am ready to go on, I suppose you needn't be afraid; besides, he don't know us.""  ""Best cut his throat and a done with it,"" a voice, which Reuben recognized as that of his old enemy, said. ""I owe him one, and it will be safest to stop his mouth.""  ""No, no,"" a third voice protested; ""I ain't going to have nothing to do with cutting throats. I don't mind running the risk of Botany Bay, but I ain't going to run the chance of being scragged. But let's move a bit away from here, while we settle it. You hit him pretty hard, but he will be coming round presently. I thought at first that you had killed him, but he's bleeding too free for that.""  The men moved some little distance away, and for some time Reuben could hear a murmured talk, but could make out nothing of what had been said. It was, he judged, a quarter of an hour before the conversation ceased. They did not return to him but remained at some distance off, and Reuben thought that he heard the footsteps of one of them going down the lane. He could feel, by a warm sensation across his cheek, that the blood was flowing freely from the wound he had received on his temple. A dull torpid feeling came over him, and after a time he again lost consciousness.  How long he remained in this state he did not know, but he was at last aroused by being lifted and thrown into the bottom of the cart. Four men then climbed up into it and the horse was started. They drove at a quick pace, and Reuben wondered why they were taking him away with them. His head ached terribly, and he suffered much from the tightness of the cords which bound his arms. The men seemed in high good humour, and talked and laughed in low tones; but the noise of the vehicle prevented Reuben hearing what was said.  It was, as far as he could judge, full two hours before the vehicle stopped. He was roughly taken out of the cart, his arms were unbound; and the men, leaping up, drove away at full speed. The spot where he had been left was very dark, for trees overshadowed it on both sides. Where he was he had no idea, but he judged that he must be fully twenty miles from the village.  His first impulse was to take the handkerchief from his mouth, and he then walked slowly along the road, in the direction from which he had come. It was, he felt sure, no use shouting; for they would have been certain to have selected some lonely spot to set him down, and there would be no chance of awakening the inhabitants of any distant cottage. He walked slowly, for he was faint with loss of blood.  After proceeding about a quarter of a mile, he emerged from the wood and came upon a spot where the road forked. Having no clue whatever as to the direction in which Lewes lay, he sat down upon a heap of stones and waited patiently for morning. He had no doubt that the burglary had been a successful one, and he bitterly regretted his neglect to keep a watch down the lane, to see that he was not surprised by the men he had heard were coming. At any rate, he hoped that he should be able to give such information as would set the constables upon the track.  It seemed to him that some three hours passed before a faint light began to dawn in the sky. By this he knew that it must be about half-past six, and calculated, therefore, he must have set out in the trap about half-past one. He now started to walk along the road, hoping that he should soon meet some labourer going to work. Stopping by a small stream which ran across the road, he washed his head and face; as he had lain on the ground after being struck, the blood had not flowed on to his clothes.  After the wash he proceeded with a brisker step. Half an hour later he met a ploughman, riding one of his team to the fields.  ""Is this the road to Lewes?"" Reuben asked.  ""Lewes? Noa, this baint the road to Lewes. I don't know nothing about the road to Lewes. This bee the road to Hastings, if you goes further. So they tell me; I ain't never been there.""  ""Is there a village anywhere about here?"" Reuben asked.  ""Ay, half a mile or so on.""  Reuben walked on till he got to the village; and then, going to a public house, obtained some refreshment and learned, from the landlord, the direction he should take to get to the main road leading to Lewes; which was, as he expected, some twenty miles away. He found that the cart had not followed the main road towards London, but had driven by crossroads for a considerable distance, before turning north.  It was late in the afternoon before Reuben arrived at Lewes, for he had been obliged to rest often by the way, and had made but slow progress. When within a few doors of his mother's house, one of the constables of the town came up to him and touched him on the shoulder.  ""I arrest you in the king's name!""  ""Arrest me! What for?"" Reuben exclaimed.  ""For breaking into the house of Squire Ellison, of Tipping, that's what it's for.""  Reuben laughed.  ""You have got the wrong man this time. I have no more to do with the burglary than a child.""  ""It's no laughing matter,"" the constable said. ""If you are innocent you have got to prove it; that ain't no business of mine. All I have got to do is to arrest you.""  So saying, and before Reuben knew what he was about, he slipped a pair of handcuffs over his wrists. Reuben flushed up. Hitherto he had scarcely taken the matter seriously, but to be marched handcuffed through the streets of Lewes was an indignity which enraged him.  ""Take these off,"" he said angrily. ""I will go quietly with you.""  ""You may or you may not,"" the man said doggedly. ""You are younger than I am, and maybe can run faster. I ain't agoing to chance it.""  Reuben saw that it was of no use to argue and, silent and pale, he walked along by the side of the constable, who retained a tight hold of his collar. A little crowd gathered speedily round, for such a sight was unusual in Lewes; and Reuben felt thankful when they reached the cells, and he was sheltered from the gaze of the public. A minute later the head constable came in.  ""Now, my lad, don't say anything to criminate yourself,"" he began; ""the less you talk, the better for you. I am sorry to see you here, for I knew your father, and I have a good character of you from your employer; so I give you my advice--keep your mouth shut.""  ""But I am not going to keep my mouth shut,"" Reuben said indignantly. ""Here am I, arrested in the public streets, marched handcuffed through the town upon a most monstrous charge, which has been brought against me without a shadow of evidence.""  ""Don't be talking, don't be talking,"" the constable said testily; ""you will hear the evidence in time enough.""  ""But I will talk. I want to tell you what's happened, and you will see that I am innocent, at once.""  ""Very well, if you will you will; but mind, don't blame me afterwards.""  Reuben told the story of his adventures from the time of leaving.  ""There,"" he said when he finished, ""isn't that enough to show that I am innocent?""  ""No,"" the chief constable said gravely, ""it's not enough to prove anything, one way or the other. I am bound to say the story looks a likely one; and if it weren't for two or three matters which I heard of, from the constable who came over from Tipping, I should have no doubt about it. However, all that is for the magistrate to decide. There will be a meeting tomorrow.""  ""But can't I be taken before a magistrate at once? There's Captain Fidler, within a mile.""  ""What would be the good?"" the chief constable said. ""You don't suppose anyone would let you out, only on the strength of the story you have told me. He could only remand you, and you could gain nothing by it.""  ""Can I see my mother?"" Reuben asked next.  ""Yes,"" the constable said, ""I will send her down a message, at once.""  Mrs. Whitney soon came up. A neighbour had brought her in the news when Reuben had been arrested, and she was on the point of starting to inquire about it when the message arrived. She was more indignant than grieved, when she heard the charge which had been brought against Reuben.  ""The idea of such a thing!"" she exclaimed. ""These constables don't seem to have natural sense. The idea of charging anyone who is known as a respectable young man with such a thing as that, and shutting him up without a question. Why, there can't be any evidence against you.""  ""There's no saying, mother,"" Reuben replied. ""You mustn't be too sure of that. Don't you remember that affair of the dog? Well, the same hand is at work now. Before, I only suspected who had done it; but I am sure now. However, whatever evidence they may have got, we know it isn't true. I have four years' good character here to speak for me. Still, it is hard that I should get into positions of this sort, without any fault of mine.""  ""It's better that it is without any fault of yours, Reuben.""  ""That is right enough, mother, so we will both keep up our spirits.""    Chapter 4: The Trial.   There were three magistrates on the bench on the following morning, when Reuben was brought up. The justice room was crowded, for the series of burglaries had caused some excitement; and the news that the house of Mr. Ellison had been broken into, and that one of the men who had been taken turned out to belong to Lewes, had created quite a sensation.  Mr. Ellison was the first to give his evidence. He testified that, on waking on the previous morning, he found that someone had been in his room during the night. He was not in the habit of locking his door, and had not been awakened. He found that a box which stood on the dressing table, containing some valuable jewelry, was gone; that his watch and that of Mrs. Ellison had been taken; that the drawers had been opened, and a case containing the more valuable jewels of his wife had also been abstracted. This was not discovered till afterwards. He first missed his watch.  He rang the servants up, for it was still early; and it was then discovered that the lower premises had been broken into, the plate chest in the butler's pantry broken open, and a large quantity of plate stolen.  ""What do you estimate the value of the articles stolen, Mr. Ellison?""  ""The value of my wife's jewels I should put down, roughly, at two thousand pounds; the silver plate might have been worth three hundred more; the watches and other articles, so far as I yet miss them, say another hundred.""  The servants proved that they found the kitchen window open, on going downstairs. It had been opened by the catch being forced back. It was not the custom to put up shutters. The pantry door, which was a strong one, had been cut with a saw round the lock. The butler testified to the plate having been safe, the night before, and the strong chest in which it was kept having been forced open.  Directly it was discovered, the constable of the village was placed in charge of the room, with orders to admit no one; and a man on horseback was sent off to Lewes, to the chief constable. The village constable gave evidence as to the state of the place, when he was put in charge.  The constable who had been sent over from Lewes then stepped into the witness box. He testified to the marks of entry of the thieves, and said that the manner in which they had gone to work, and in which the door had been sawn through, and the chest forced open, seemed to show that it was the work of practised hands. On examining closely the butler's pantry, he found a powerful screwdriver and a heavy chisel. These corresponded to marks in the lid, and had evidently been used for the purpose of forcing it open. They had the initials ""R W."" burnt in the handles. The inmates of the house all denied any knowledge of these tools.  Mr. Ellison had been present when he showed them to Mrs. Ellison. On looking at them she said at once:  ""R. W. Why, that must be Reuben Whitney, that wicked boy, again.""  Upon making inquiries, he found that the man named worked at Mr. Penfold's, the mill wright at Lewes. He returned there at once and, going to Mr. Penfold, found the prisoner was absent from work. The men identified the brand on the tools as that of the prisoner. Another constable proved the arrest.  The chief constable then read the statement that the prisoner had made to him. The magistrates conferred together for a few minutes, in an undertone.  ""Mrs. Ellison,"" the senior of them said, addressing that lady, who was sitting on a chair placed at the upper end of the court, ""we are sorry to trouble you, but we must ask you to go into the witness box.  ""I wish to ask you,"" he went on, when she had taken her stand in the box, ""how it was you at once connected the initials with the prisoner?""  ""Because he had at one time lived in the village, and was employed assisting our gardener. He was discharged on suspicion of having poisoned a watchdog which had bit him; and as the three dogs about the place had all been poisoned, on the night when the house was broken into, his name had been in my mind and, on seeing the initials, I naturally recognized them at once.""  There was a deep silence in the court, when Mrs. Ellison gave her evidence. Hitherto the impression had been rather favourable to the prisoner. His story, though strange, had been by no means impossible and, if true, would have completely accounted for the finding of the tools, which were the only evidence against him. The evidence of Mrs. Ellison, however, entirely altered the complexion of the case.  Reuben had stood, quiet and composed, during the hearing. His countenance had evinced no surprise or emotion, when the tools were produced. He had, indeed, upon thinking the matter over before coming into court, come to the conclusion that the tools, which he had in a small basket at the time he was attacked, had been found in or near the house; having been left there purposely, by Tom Thorne, in order to throw suspicion upon him. Their production, therefore, was no surprise to him.  A slight shade had passed over his face when Mrs. Ellison entered the witness box. Glancing at the squire as she gave her evidence, Reuben saw that Mr. Ellison looked greatly vexed and annoyed. As before, at the conclusion of the evidence of each witness, Reuben was asked if he had any question to put. He hesitated for a moment and then, as before, replied in the negative.  Again the magistrates consulted together.  ""Mr. Ellison, we shall be obliged if you will enter the witness box again. In your former evidence, Mr. Ellison, you said nothing in any way relating to the prisoner; but it now seems you had a previous acquaintance with him. Will you tell the court what it is?""  ""I have not much to say,"" the squire said. ""As a boy he lived in the village with his mother, a most respectable person; and widow of Jacob Whitney, a miller in a good way of business, who, as it may be in your memory, was found drowned in his mill pond some seven or eight years ago. The widow, being in reduced circumstances, settled in Tipping. The boy was an intelligent lad and, when the boy employed in my garden left, I gave him the place.  He gave every satisfaction. One day he was severely bitten by the watchdog and, three days later, the dog was found poisoned. My gardener saw a boy running away from the spot, a quarter of an hour before the dog died. He believed it to be the prisoner, but it was too dark for him to distinguish the features.  ""At the time, I certainly suspected that he had been guilty of poisoning the dog and, in spite of his denying that he had anything to do with it, as he was unable to account for where he was at the time the boy was seen, I discharged him. I wish to say publicly that I have deeply regretted having done so, ever since, and that I consider I acted hastily and wrongly in so doing. Considering his previous good character, I ought not to have assumed his guilt without more positive evidence than I had before me. I may also say that the schoolmaster of our village will give the prisoner the highest character for truthfulness, and he has known him ever since. His present employer, Mr. Penfold, is also, I believe, ready to testify to his excellent conduct during his four years of apprenticeship.""  ""I suppose, Mr. Ellison,"" the senior magistrate said, ""you have not, at any time since the poisoning of the dog, obtained any actual evidence which would show that you were mistaken in your first view, and that your subsequent change of opinion was due solely to your general view of the boy's character, so far as you knew it.""  ""That is so,"" the squire assented and, no further question being asked, he resumed his seat. His evidence had caused surprise and some little amusement in court. It was clear that there was a strong difference of opinion between him and his wife on the subject; and that, while the lady had something like an animus against the prisoner, the squire was strongly impressed in his favour. After some consultation, the magistrate said:  ""The case will be remanded until this day week, to see if further evidence is forthcoming; but I may say that, under the present circumstances of the case, we shall feel ourselves obliged to send it for trial. The prisoner's account of his proceedings, from the time he left Lewes on the previous evening up to that of his return and arrest here, may be true; but so far it is entirely unsupported. On the other hand, we have the evidence of the tools, admitted to belong to him, being found on the scene of the burglary. We have the further important fact that he had been formerly employed upon the place; and had, it may be supposed, some knowledge of the premises. He had been discharged upon a suspicion, rightfully or wrongly entertained, of his having poisoned a dog belonging to Mr. Ellison, and there is reason for the belief that the dogs poisoned before the burglary were got at by some one acquainted with the place.""  ""Will it be any use my calling evidence as to character, at the next meeting?"" Reuben asked.  ""No,"" the magistrate said. ""Evidence of that kind will be useful at the trial, when the matter will be thoroughly sifted. We only have to decide that there is prima facie evidence connecting you with the offence, and of that there can be no doubt.""  At the sitting a week later, no fresh evidence was produced; and Reuben was committed for trial at the next assizes. Public opinion in Lewes ran high on the subject of Reuben's guilt or innocence. The other workmen at the mill wright's were strongly in his favour--he was very popular among his fellows--and they pointed out that several hands must have been concerned in the business, that he was never seen about in public houses of an evening, or was likely to have any connection with bad characters. Was it probable, if he had gone about such a job as that, he would have taken tools marked with his own initials; or if he had, that he would have been fool enough to leave them behind?  Upon the other hand, opinion in general ran strongly against him. His story was declared to be utterly improbable, and a fellow who had once been dismissed for poisoning a dog would be likely, at any future time, to revenge himself upon the employer who turned him off. As to Mr. Ellison's declaration of his subsequent opinion that he acted hastily, little weight was attached to it. Everyone knew Squire Ellison was a kind-hearted man, and as he acknowledged himself that he had obtained no evidence which would satisfy him that he had acted wrongly in the first case, it was clear that it was from mere kindness of heart that he had changed his mind on the subject.  At Tipping the subject was never mentioned. The squire and Mrs. Ellison had, on the drive home, had the most serious quarrel which had ever taken place during their wedded life; which had ended by the former saying:  ""If anyone had ever told me before, Mary, that you were a vindictive woman, I should have knocked him down. I might do so now, but I should know in my heart that he had spoken truly. For some reason or other you took a prejudice against that boy, and you never forgave his mother for standing up in his defence. I was shocked, downright shocked, when you gave your evidence in court.""  Mrs. Ellison had been too much offended to reply, and the rest of the drive had been passed in silence. Upon their return home the girls were full of eager questions, but the squire said shortly:  ""My dears, the less we talk about it, the better. Your mother and I differ entirely on the subject. She believes that Reuben Whitney is guilty. I am absolutely convinced he is innocent. Therefore, if you please, we will not discuss it.""  The following morning Kate Ellison went down to the school house.  ""Mr. Shrewsbury,"" she said, putting her head in at the door, ""could you come out for two or three minutes? I want particularly to speak to you.  ""Have you heard what took place yesterday, at Lewes?"" she asked when he came out.  ""Yes, Miss Ellison. I saw Jones the constable last night, and he told me all that had been said in court.""  ""And you think Reuben Whitney is innocent?"" she asked eagerly.  ""I am quite sure of it, Miss Ellison--as sure as I am of my own existence. For anyone who knows him to have a doubt is absolutely absurd. A finer young fellow than Reuben it would be hard to find.""  ""But what did he say? How did he account for his tools being found there?""  The schoolmaster repeated the account Reuben had given, and said:  ""When the trial comes off I shall, of course, go over; and testify both as to his general conduct and to the fact that he had, as he said, promised to bring over his tools to put up some shelves in my cupboards.""  ""Do you think he will get off, Mr. Shrewsbury?"" she asked anxiously.  ""I should hope so, Miss Ellison, but I can't disguise from myself that it is by no means certain. That unfortunate old business about the dog will tell terribly against him; and though I am perfectly sure that his account of what took place is correct, there is nothing to confirm it. It is just the sort of story, they will say, that he would naturally get up to account for his absence, and for the tools being found. Of course, if the jury knew him as well as I do the result would be certain; but I have been trying to look at the facts as if he were a stranger, and I can't say what decision I should come to, in such a case. Still, of course, the high character that will be given him, and the fact that there is no evidence whatever connecting him, in any way, with bad characters, must count immensely in his favour.""  The assizes were to take place only a fortnight after the date of Reuben's committal. Mrs. Whitney had engaged a lawyer in the town to defend her son and, to the surprise of this gentleman, Mr. Ellison called upon him two or three days later, and said:  ""Mr. Brogden, I hear that you have been engaged by Mrs. Whitney to defend her son. I don't believe the young fellow is guilty, and therefore I authorize you to spend any sum that may be necessary in getting up his defence; and I wish you to instruct a counsel to appear for him. Of course I cannot appear openly in the matter, and my name must not be mentioned, but I will guarantee all expenses.  ""It seems to me that it would be desirable to find out, if possible, the village where he says he breakfasted, and asked the way to Lewes. In his story he says he didn't know the name of the village but, as he was told it was about twenty miles from Lewes, and he can describe the road he followed, there ought to be no difficulty in finding it.  ""I should advise you to have a chat with Shrewsbury, the schoolmaster at Tipping. He is a great friend of the lad's, and a very intelligent fellow. He may be able to suggest some points to be followed up. At any rate, do all you can.""  Reuben had another adherent who was also acting on his behalf. The afternoon before the trial, Kate Ellison stopped before the blacksmith shop in the village and, seeing that Jacob Priestley the smith was at work, alone, she entered.  ""Is it true, Jacob, that you have been summoned on the jury at Lewes tomorrow?""  ""Yes, miss, it bee true, sureley. It be four years since anyone in the village was summoned, and it be mighty hard that they should have picked upon me. Still, I have never been called before, so I suppose I mustn't grumble; but it be hard to be taken away from work, to waste one's time in a court, and they say the 'sizes ull last for three days.""  ""Well, Jacob, you know that Reuben Whitney is going to be tried for robbery at our house.""  ""Yes, miss; so they says.""  ""Well, what do you think about it, Jacob?""  ""I don't think nothing one way or the other, miss. Most folks says as how he must have done it, 'cause as how he poisoned squire's dog afore.""  ""He didn't do anything of the sort, Jacob; and it's very wicked of people to say so. He is innocent, quite innocent. I am sure he is, and papa is quite sure, too; and he will be terribly put out if he is found guilty. So I want you to promise me that, whatever the others think, you will hold out that he is innocent.""  ""Well, miss,"" the smith said, scratching his head, ""if you be sure of it, and squire be sure, I suppose there can't be no doubt about it, for who should know better than squire; and I am sure I wouldn't go to put him about, for a better landlord than squire ain't to be found in the county. So you tell him, miss, as I will hold out.""  ""But papa doesn't know that I have come down here, Jacob. It wouldn't do for him to interfere, you know; especially as he is a magistrate himself. You mustn't mention to anyone that I have spoken to you about it--not to anyone, Jacob, not even to your wife--but I can tell you the squire will be heartily pleased if he is found innocent, and he will be terribly put out if he is found guilty.""  ""All right, miss,"" the smith replied. ""I understand, and no one sha'n't know as you have spoken to me aboot it. It be quite enough for I to know as the squire knows as he's innocent. It ain't likely as I should stick my opinion up against his.""  The day after he heard of Reuben's arrest, the schoolmaster went over to see him; and as he was the bearer of a letter from Mr. Ellison to the governor of the jail, he was able to obtain admittance.  ""Was there ever such an unfortunate fellow as I am?"" Reuben exclaimed, after the first hearty greeting. ""Here am I for the second time accused of a crime of which I am innocent; and from which, indeed, in the present case I am a sufferer; and all this has come about, simply because I went out of my way to inquire into what seemed to me a suspicious business.""  ""Tell me all about it, Reuben. I have heard the statement you made to the chief constable; but tell it me again, with every detail you can think of. Some circumstance, which appears to you as trifling, may furnish a clue.""  ""I have seen Mr. Brogden, the lawyer. I have told him all that happened,"" Reuben said; ""but of course, I will gladly tell you again.""  And Reuben repeated the story of the adventure, with every detail that he could think of; speaking slowly, as the schoolmaster wrote it down at length.  ""I will see what I can make of it, when I think it over,"" Mr. Shrewsbury said. ""Of course, as it stands, it is so natural and probable that it would clear you at once; had it not been for that unfortunate dog business before, and the supposition, excited by it, that you had a feeling of hostility to the squire. I shall be able partly to dispose of that, for I can swear that you have frequently spoken to me of the squire in tones of respect and liking; and that, although you regretted the manner in which you left his service, you felt no ill will against him on account of it. Moreover, I shall be able to prove that the reasons you gave for having your tools with you was a true one; and although I cannot swear that I expected you specially on that evening, the fact that you were in the habit of coming over, at times, to see me, cannot but corroborate your story.  ""I shall get leave for two or three days, and will hunt up the village where you breakfasted.""  ""Thank you very much,"" Reuben said, ""though I have been thinking it over, and do not see that the evidence of the people at the public house would help me much. It will simply prove that I passed through there in the morning; but will not show, in any way, whether I went willingly as far as that, as one of the party who broke into the house, or whether I was taken there.""  ""They can probably prove that you looked pale and exhausted,"" the schoolmaster said.  ""I fancy I should look pale, in any case,"" Reuben said, ""if I had gone through such a night's work as that of breaking into the squire's.""  ""Well, keep up your courage, Reuben. You may be quite sure that your friends will do all in their power for you. I shall go now and have a chat with your mother. I am afraid that she will want comforting more than you do.""  ""Yes,"" Reuben agreed, ""I am afraid so. Somehow I don't seem to take it to heart much. I shall feel it more afterwards, perhaps; but at present, the whole thing seems so extraordinary that I can't quite realize that I am in danger of being sent to Botany Bay. The worst of it is that, even if I am acquitted, lots of people will still think I am guilty. There is only one thing that can really prove my innocence, and that is the arrest of Tom Thorne, and his father.""  ""I hear,"" the schoolmaster said, ""that the chief constable has written up to Bow Street, for them to put the runners on the traces of those two scoundrels. Whether they believe your story or not, it is quite evident that more than one person was concerned in the affair. Their theory, of course, is that you quarrelled with the others over the division of the spoil; and got that knock on the head, which is a very severe one. I went down yesterday with Jones, to see the spot where you said you were assaulted. There were marks where the horse stopped, and marks of feet in the field, and a patch of blood; all of which goes to prove that your story may be true, but unfortunately it doesn't prove that it was because, according to the theory against you, you might have been assaulted after the robbery, as well as before it.""  ""But in that case,"" Reuben said, ""why should they have taken the trouble to carry me twenty miles away?""  ""Yes, there is of course that question,"" the schoolmaster said thoughtfully; ""but then, on the other hand, why did they take the trouble in case you were not an accomplice? In both cases the answer is the same--they did it to prevent your giving the alarm, until they had got far away from the scene. They didn't like to murder you, because of the consequences to themselves; but they would not risk your recovering consciousness and getting up an early pursuit. It cuts both ways, you see.""  ""So it does,"" Reuben assented. ""It's just a question of belief; and I own, myself, that that old dog business is very much against me; and that I can't blame anyone who considers me guilty.""  Reuben's was the last case taken at the assizes, and occasioned a good deal of interest in that part of Sussex, partly owing to the position of Squire Ellison, partly to the nature of the defence set up, as to which opinion was a good deal divided. The evidence for the prosecution was, to a great extent, similar to that given at the inquiry before the magistrates. Unfortunately for Reuben, the judge was notoriously a severe one; and his bias, from the first, appeared to be against the prisoner. Mr. Ellison was closely questioned by the prosecutor as to the poisoning of his dog, as this was considered to show a particular animus on the part of Reuben. He again repeated his conviction of Reuben's innocence in that affair.  ""But what reason have you, Mr. Ellison,"" the counsel for the prosecution asked blandly, ""for changing your opinion on the subject?""  This was just the question which the squire could not answer satisfactorily; and was a particularly irritating one, because it had often been triumphantly asked by his wife.  ""I can really give no particular reason,"" he said, ""except that, on reflection, the boy's previous character and antecedents convinced me that he could not have done such an act.""  ""In fact,"" the counsel said suavely, ""you were influenced by your own goodness of heart, Mr. Ellison, in thus laying aside a conviction which the facts had, at the time, forced upon you.""  ""I don't look upon it in that light,"" the squire replied shortly. ""I consider that in the first instance I acted hastily and unadvisedly, and on consideration I saw that I had done so.""  ""I am afraid, Mr. Ellison,"" the counsel said, ""that you will not persuade the jury to agree with you.""  ""I have only one or two questions to ask you,"" the counsel for the defence said, when he rose to cross-examine, ""for indeed your evidence is, as I think the jury will agree, altogether in favour of the prisoner. In the first place, was the lad, when in your employment, ever upstairs in your house?""  ""Not that I know of,"" the squire replied. ""Certainly in the course of his duties he would never be there. Indeed, it would be very seldom that he would even enter the kitchen, except to bring in vegetables. Certainly he would never pass through to go upstairs. He could not possibly have done so without exciting attention and remarks.""  ""He would therefore, Mr. Ellison, have no means of possessing any knowledge as to the internal arrangements of your house, beyond that possessed by the other people in the village?""  ""None whatever,"" Mr. Ellison replied.  ""Now, as to that unfortunate affair of the poisoning of your dog. Your opinion, as to the innocence of the prisoner in that matter, is not a recent one--not the outcome of his after good conduct and character?""  ""Not at all,"" Mr. Ellison said. ""I changed my opinion on the matter very shortly, indeed, after the affair.""  ""Within a few days, I think I may say?"" the counsel asked.  ""Within a very few days; I may almost say within a few hours,"" the squire replied. ""The boy's story, told not to me but to another, that he believed the dog was poisoned by another lad in the village who owed him a grudge, and who has since turned out an exceedingly bad character, struck me as being very much more probable than that he should do it, himself.""  Mrs. Ellison was next called. Her evidence as to the robbery was a mere repetition of that given by the squire. The counsel then turned to the question of the poisoning.  ""I would rather say nothing about it,"" Mrs. Ellison said. ""It is a matter which has been productive of much pain to me, and I would rather say nothing about it.""  ""But you must, madam,"" the judge said sharply. ""You are here to answer any question which may enable the jury to form an opinion on this case.""  ""I am sorry to press you, Mrs. Ellison,"" the counsel continued, ""but I really must do so. You took a different opinion to that held by your husband?""  ""I regret to say that I did. Mr. Ellison told me the reasons he had for suspecting the boy. I thought those reasons sufficient, and have seen no cause for changing my opinion.""  After the evidence for the prosecution had been given, the counsel for the defence pointed out that there was, in fact, no evidence whatever connecting Reuben with the robbery, beyond the discovery of his tools on the premises; and that, as to this trumpery story of the poisoning a dog, four years before, apparently only for the purpose of showing some sort of animus, he regarded it as altogether contemptible. When a man meant to commit a burglary in a house, he did so in order to obtain possession of the goods, and not from any spite against the owner. Had this young fellow felt any malice, for this ridiculous charge on which he had been dismissed, he would not have allied himself with burglars to rob the house; but would probably have vented his spite in the usual fashion, by setting fire to a stack or outhouse; but so far as he could see, there was no foundation for the charge brought against him, and they had already heard Mr. Ellison declare that he regretted he had suspected him, and that he believed him to be innocent.  But even had it been proved, up to the hilt, that the prisoner had poisoned the dog, he should still hold it as wholly unconnected with the present matter. If he had poisoned the dog, what then? It was not a heinous sin, nor would it affect his moral character. No boy likes having a piece taken out of his calf by a savage dog, and there would have been nothing so very dreadful had he revenged himself. It was probable that, even among the jury, there was one or more who, if he had not absolutely set poison for his neighbour's cats, for destroying his young chickens or scratching up his flower beds, had threatened to do so, and would not have regarded it as a very serious crime had he done so.  Therefore he contended that the jury should put this trumpery affair altogether out of their minds; on the double ground that, in the first place, the prisoner at the bar did not poison the dog; and that, had he done so, it would have had nothing whatever to do with the present affair.  ""Why, gentlemen,"" he said, ""it is an insult to your understanding to ask you to credit that this young fellow--whose character, which I shall presently prove to you, by unimpeachable evidence, is of the highest kind--has, for four years, cherished such malice against his employer, for dismissing him mistakenly, that he has become the consort of thieves and burglars, has stained his hands in crime, and rendered himself liable to transportation, for the purpose merely of spiting that gentleman. Such a contention would be absolutely absurd. I must beg you to dismiss it altogether from your mind, and approach it from a different standpoint, altogether. Divested of this extraneous business, the matter is a most simple one.  ""The prisoner left his mother's cottage, at seven o'clock in the evening, to go over for an hour or two to his friend Mr. Shrewsbury, the schoolmaster of Tipping. He took with him a few tools, as he had promised to put some shelves in his friend's house. On the way he heard some talking down a lane, which he knew led to only a field. Thinking it strange, he went to see who it was and, some distance down, he found a horse and cart standing and, listening to the conversation of two men who were sitting under the hedge, he heard enough to inform him that a burglary was intended upon the house of Mr. Ellison. He was about to make off to give the alarm, when he was suddenly attacked by some men who had come up behind, and was felled to the ground. While lying insensible, he was bound hand and foot and left in a ditch; where he remained till the burglars returned from completing the work on hand. They then threw him into the cart, and put him down some twenty miles away. Being greatly exhausted by loss of blood, it was late in the afternoon before he arrived at Lewes, when he was at once arrested.  ""This, gentlemen, is the prisoner's story, as related to the chief constable when he was taken to the lockup. Nothing can be simpler or more probable; and in some points, at least, I shall be able to confirm it by independent testimony. Mr. Shrewsbury will tell you that the prisoner had arranged to come over to see him, and bring his tools. He will also tell you that, two days after the prisoner's arrest, he went with Jones, the village constable, and found the marks where the horse and trap had stood; while, just inside the field, the grass was trampled with feet; and in the bottom of the dry ditch was a great dark patch, which he was able to ascertain to be blood. Doctor Hewitt will tell you that he was called in to strap up the prisoner's head, after his arrest; and that the cut was a very severe one, and must have been inflicted by a heavy weapon, with great force.  ""I am convinced, gentlemen, that after hearing this evidence you will agree with me, not only that the prisoner is perfectly innocent of the charge, but that he is a most ill-used person; and that it is a matter of surprise and regret that the magistrates should have committed him for trial, when the only shadow of evidence against him was the discovery of these tools, a discovery which he at once explained. Of other evidence, there is not one jot or tittle. No attempt has been made to prove that the prisoner was in the habit of consorting with bad characters; no attempt has been made to show any connection, whatever, between him and the men who came in a horse and trap across the hills, for the purpose of effecting a burglary at Mr. Ellison's; and who, as we know, did effect it. No scrap of the property stolen from the house has been found upon him and, in order to account for the severe wound on his head, the counsel for the prosecution has started the hypothesis that it was given in the course of a quarrel, during the division of the plunder.  ""But had that been the case, gentlemen, the prisoner would not have been standing here alone. Robbed and ill-treated by these companions of his, he would naturally have put the officers of justice on their track and, as he must have been in communication with them, and well acquainted with their ways and haunts, he could have given information which would have led to their early arrest. He could well have done this, for the crown would have made no difficulty, whatever, in promising a lad like this a free pardon, on condition of his turning evidence against these burglars; whose mode of procedure shows them to have been old hands, and who are, no doubt, the same who have committed the various robberies which have lately taken place in this part of the country.  ""The prisoner is the son of highly respectable parents. His employer will come before you, and give you evidence of the extremely high character he bears. Mr. Shrewsbury will tell you that he has, for the last four years, devoted no inconsiderable portion of his leisure time to improve his education, and enable him to recover the position occupied by his father, who was a much-respected miller in this neighbourhood. I shall leave the case in your hands, gentlemen, with an absolute confidence that you will, without a moment's hesitation, find a verdict proclaiming the innocence of my client; and enable him to leave the dock, without a stain upon his character.""    Chapter 5: Not Guilty!   The schoolmaster was the first witness called for the defence. After stating that, although no evening was actually settled for his coming over, he expected the prisoner one evening that week; and that he had promised to bring his tools over, to do a little job of carpentering; he also detailed his visit to the lane, and the result of his observation there; and then gave Reuben the highest character, saying that he had known him for five years, and that he had an absolute confidence in his integrity and honesty.  ""He has from the first,"" he said, ""proved a most intelligent and hard-working boy, anxious to improve himself and to get on in the world. He has learnt all that I could teach him, and more. He is one of the last persons in the world whom I should consider capable of the crime with which he is charged. As to his having any animosity to Mr. Ellison, I can swear that, on many different occasions, he has expressed his high opinion of him; and has declared that it was quite natural that, with the evidence before him, he should have thought him guilty of poisoning the dog.""  The keeper of the wayside public house, where he had breakfasted, proved that he was struck with the prisoner's appearance when he entered; that he was very pale, and seemed scarcely able to walk. He had asked him the nearest way to Lewes, and had inquired whether there was any chance of getting a lift; as he was anxious to get back, as soon as possible.  Mr. Penfold was the next witness. He said that the prisoner had been apprenticed to him, four years previously; that his general conduct had been most excellent, and that he was remarkably quick and intelligent, and was an excellent workman. During the time that he had been employed, he had never lost a day.  ""At the time he was apprenticed to you, Mr. Penfold,"" Reuben's counsel asked, ""were you aware that the lad had been summarily discharged by Mr. Ellison?""  ""I was aware of that fact,"" Mr. Penfold answered; and Reuben, with surprise, looked at his employer.  ""From whom did you hear of it?""  ""I heard of it from Mr. Ellison himself, who called upon me about the matter.""  ""How was it he came to call upon you, Mr. Penfold?""  ""The prisoner's mother had applied to me about apprenticing her son. I had asked 50 pounds premium, and said that it wasn't my custom to pay any wages for the first year. She said she could only afford 20 pounds, and I thought that was an end of the matter until, a few days later, Mr. Ellison called upon me, and said that he had heard from the schoolmaster in his village, who was a friend of the boy's mother, how matters stood; and that her application had fallen through, owing to her being unable to find more than 20 pounds.  ""I said that this was so. Mr. Ellison then said that he was prepared to make up the deficiency, that he had a regard for the boy's father; and that, moreover, he himself had, through a hasty misconception regarding the poisoning of the dog, discharged the lad from his service; and that he felt uneasy, in his mind, at having been guilty of a piece of injustice. Over and above the 30 pounds, he gave me six pound ten; in order that I might pay the boy half a crown a week, for the first year, which he said would be a matter of consequence to his mother. He requested me on no account to let Mrs. Whitney know that he had intervened in the matter, but to represent that I changed my mind, and was willing to take the 20 pounds she offered as a premium. He was particularly anxious on this point; because, he said, she would certainly refuse to accept assistance from him, owing to that unfortunate affair about the dog.  ""I may say that, from that time to this, I have not mentioned the fact to anyone; and the sum of 20 pounds was inserted in the indenture of apprenticeship.""  There was a little movement of applause in the court, as Mr. Penfold gave his evidence; and Reuben looked gratefully towards Mr. Ellison, and said heartily:  ""I thank you, sir, with all my heart.""  The foreman of the yard was next examined. He confirmed the high character Mr. Penfold had given Reuben, and adding that he knew the lad never entered a public house, but spent his evenings almost entirely at home studying; for that he himself had, many times, called in and had, upon every occasion, found him so employed.  The counsel for the prosecution then addressed the jury, and threw discredit upon Reuben's narrative; which, he said, was unsupported in any material particular. That he met the rest of the party in the lane was likely enough. He may have returned there with them after the burglary, and probably it was there that, in a quarrel over the spoil, he received the blow of which you have heard.  ""My learned friend has told you to dismiss from your mind the question about that poisoning of the dog, four years ago; but it is impossible for you to do so. You have heard that the dog was poisoned, and that the evidence was so strong that his employer at once dismissed him. It is true that Mr. Ellison has told you that he afterwards changed his mind on the subject; but after the evidence which Mr. Penfold has given, of the kindness of that gentleman's heart, you will readily understand that no great stress can be laid upon this. The matter, so far from being trivial, as my friend represents it, is highly important; inasmuch as here we find that, again, the dogs have been poisoned just as on the first occasion. It is clear that burglars from London would be ignorant of the whereabouts of the kennels, and were not likely to have come down provided with a store of poisoned meat; had they not known, from persons well acquainted with the place, of the steps that would have to be taken before an entry could be effected into the house. You will therefore see the extreme importance of this point.  ""I am perfectly ready to admit that the evidence is of a wholly circumstantial nature but, from the nature of the case, it is necessary that this should be so. Had Mrs. or Mr. Ellison awoke, when the thieves entered their room, it is probable that much more evidence would be forthcoming. It is, however, for you to weigh the probabilities of the case. You have to consider whether the theory which I have laid before you, as to the connection of the prisoner with this affair, or this wild story which he tells you, is the most probable.""  The judge then summed up, with a strong bias against Reuben. He told them that evidence for character was, of course, of importance; but that it must not be relied upon too far. The prisoner appeared undoubtedly to be intelligent and well-conducted, but unfortunately his experience told him that many criminals were men of unusual intelligence. Stress had been laid, by the counsel for the defence, upon the fact that the prisoner was not known, at any time, to have consorted with suspicious characters; but this, after all, was only negative evidence. Affairs of this sort were always conducted with secrecy and, had one of these men come down from London, as was probable enough, to make inquiries as to houses which could be broken into with a prospect of good booty, he would naturally not make himself conspicuous.  They had heard the two stories, and must judge for themselves; but he agreed, with the counsel for the prosecution, that the fact that the prisoner had been discharged by Mr. Ellison for poisoning a dog, and that on the night of the robbery other dogs were found poisoned, and that probably by some one acquainted with the locality, could not but have an influence upon their minds. At the same time he would tell them that, if they had a doubt in their minds, it was their duty to give the prisoner the benefit of that doubt.  The jury consulted together for a minute or two in the jury box, and then expressed their desire to retire. A buzz of talk arose in the court, when they had left. Opinion was divided as to what the verdict would be. When the counsel for the defence sat down, the general opinion was that the prisoner would be certainly acquitted; but the speech of the counsel for the prosecution, and the summing up of the judge, had caused a reaction, and few doubted now that the verdict would be guilty.  So Reuben himself thought. It was he felt hard that, standing there to be tried for burglary, the decision should, in fact, depend upon that unjust charge which had, four years ago, been brought against him. Reuben was in the habit of what he called arguing things out by himself; and as he stood there, waiting for the verdict, he tried to put himself in the position of the jury; and he felt that, in that case, he should have difficulty in coming to a decision.  It was not until after the lamps had been lighted that the jury returned into the box. The crier shouted for order, and there was not a sound heard, as the foreman told the judge that they were not agreed upon their verdict.  ""Then you must go back, gentlemen, until you are,"" the judge said.  ""We are eleven one way, and one the other. Won't that do, my lord?""  ""No, sir,"" the judge replied. ""You must be unanimous.""  The jury again retired, the judge and counsel went off to dine at the hotel, and almost all the public trooped out. Two hours later, as the jury did not return, Reuben Whitney was taken back to the jail, and the court closed. At nine o'clock in the morning, a warder entered.  ""The jury have come back into the court,"" he said. ""They are going to return a verdict.""  Reuben was again placed in the dock. The seats open to the public quickly filled, as the news spread through the town. Several of the members of the bar dropped in, and then the judge came in and took his seat.  Reuben had occupied the time in trying to judge, from the faces of the jury, what their verdict was going to be. They looked sulky and tired. But as Reuben's eye rested on Jacob Priestley, whom he had at once recognized among the jury, the smith gave him an encouraging wink. At least, so Reuben thought; but as the next moment he was looking as surly as the rest, he thought that he must have been mistaken.  ""Are you agreed, gentlemen, as to the verdict you find in this case?"" the judge asked.  ""We are, my lord,"" the foreman replied.  ""Do you find the prisoner guilty or not guilty?""  ""Not guilty, my lord.""  ""Very well, gentlemen,"" the judge said tartly. ""It is your verdict, not mine.""  At the foreman's word a thrill had run through the court; for when it was known, the evening before, that eleven were one way and one the other, the belief had been general that the majority were for a conviction. Reuben himself had so understood it, and the verdict was a complete surprise to him.  [Illustration: Reuben Whitney Acquitted of the Charge of Burglary]  The constable raised the bar for him to leave the dock, and as he moved out his friend the schoolmaster pushed forward, and shook him warmly by the hand.  ""Thank God for that verdict, Reuben. I am indeed rejoiced, and I own I hardly expected it.""  ""I didn't expect it at all,"" Reuben said in a choked voice, for his sudden liberation had shaken him, more than his arrest or any of the subsequent proceedings had done.  ""I congratulate you heartily, Reuben,"" Mr. Ellison said, putting his hand on his shoulder.  The squire had waited at Lewes until ten o'clock on the previous evening, and had driven over again the first thing in the morning, so anxious was he about the verdict.  ""I didn't believe you guilty this time, my boy, from the first. I was glad indeed to hear the verdict; for after the judge's summing up, I was sorely uneasy.  ""And now, Reuben, I hope,"" he said, as they entered the street, ""that you have quite forgiven me for that old business. It has been the unfortunate cause of getting you into this affair. Had it not been for that no one would ever, for a moment, have doubted the truth of your story.""  ""There is nothing to forgive, squire,"" Reuben said. ""I never blamed you for it, from the first; and even had I done so, your goodness, of which I only heard yesterday, would have made up, many times, for any mistake you may have made then.""  ""That is right, my lad,"" the squire said. ""I am glad that matter is made up. And now I will not keep you, for I know you will want to be off home to your mother.""  Reuben walked quietly home, so as to give the schoolmaster, who had hurried on ahead, time to break the news of his acquittal to his mother. Mrs. Whitney had remained in court during the trial, but had retired when the jury left to consider their verdict, being completely overcome with agitation and excitement. The schoolmaster had slept in the house, and had persuaded her not to go to the court in the morning; fearing as he did that the verdict would be a hostile one. She completely broke down when she was told the news, and was still sobbing when Reuben arrived.  The schoolmaster at once took his leave, leaving mother and son together; and promised them to return in a day or two. When he again came over, he saw at once that Mrs. Whitney was looking depressed and unhappy.  ""What do you think, Mr. Shrewsbury? Reuben says that he shall go abroad, out to Australia. I have talked against it till I am hoarse, but it's no good. I hope you will persuade him to give up such a mad idea.""  ""I will hear what he has to say first, Mrs. Whitney. Reuben has generally a good deal to say for his side of a question, and I must hear his reasons before I can argue against them.  ""Now, Reuben, what have you to say for yourself?""  ""I made up my mind while I was in jail,"" Reuben replied, ""that if I was acquitted, I would go right away. These things stick to a man all through his life. That first affair, four years ago, nearly got me transported now; and if a small matter like that did me such harm, what will this do? If I had been proved to be innocent, it would have been different; but as it is, I believe nine people out of ten in court thought I was guilty; and I am convinced that the jury were eleven to one against me, only the twelfth was more obstinate than they were, and so they gave in. I believe it was Jacob Priestley the blacksmith who held out, for the sake of old times.  ""At any rate, a great many people will think me guilty, all their lives, unless something turns up to prove my innocence. Mother says we might settle somewhere else, where we ain't known; but I should never feel safe. Years on, someone from Lewes might see me and tell the story; or Tom Thorne might keep on my track. I won't risk it.  ""I have been to Mr. Penfold, and he says if I am determined to go, he will cancel my indenture for me. I have no doubt I shall find work of some sort, out there. I am a pretty good workman now at my own craft and, if I can't get work at that, I can turn my hand to something else.  ""My only trouble is about mother. I want her to go with me. I could make a living for her out there, but she won't have it. She says six months at sea will kill her, and then she has all sorts of ideas in her head about the natives. However I hope that, in two or three years' time, I shall be able to write and tell her that I have comfortably settled, and have a good home ready for her to come to; and that then she will join me.""  ""Never,"" Mrs. Whitney said, excitedly. ""I was born at Lewes, and I have lived near it all my days, and I will die here. I am not going to tramp all over the world, and settle down among black people, in outlandish parts. I could not do it, Mr. Shrewsbury. It's cruel of him to ask me.""  The schoolmaster was silent for a minute. He saw that Reuben's mind was firmly made up, and he could not deny the force of his reasoning. It was true that many people still considered him guilty. It was true that this story might crop up again, years on, and ruin his life. It did seem that the best thing he could do was to leave the country.  ""Australia is not so bad a place as you fancy, Mrs. Whitney,"" he said at last. ""They do have troubles with the natives, certainly, in the outlying settlements; but in the towns you have no more trouble than you have here. Besides, every year the white population is increasing, and the black diminishing. Six months' voyage is not so dreadful as it seems. And though I do think that, if Reuben goes out, it will be better for you to remain quietly here till he has a home prepared for you, I think that, when the time comes, you will change your mind about it.  ""As to Reuben himself, I must own there's a good deal of force in what he says; and that until those Thornes have been sent out of the country, his story might follow him. And I have no doubt he would do well out there. He is a good workman for his age and, as he says, can turn his hand to almost anything. Labour is scarce out there and, as he has got his head screwed on the right way, I have no doubt that he will fall on his feet.""  ""I didn't expect this of you, Mr. Shrewsbury,"" Mrs. Whitney said, beginning to cry. ""I thought you would have taken my part, and now you are going right against me.""  ""Not against you, Mrs. Whitney, for I think that Reuben's plan is best for you both. He cannot but suffer, if he remains here; and you will be unhappy in seeing him suffer. Great as the loss would be to you, I believe that you would be happier here, alone, than you would be were you to see him in constant trouble and worry. At any rate you would have the option, if you found life intolerably dull here, of joining him out there at any time.  ""But how do you intend to get out, Reuben?"" he asked, seeing that Mrs. Whitney made no answer, but again relapsed into tears.  ""I shall work my way out,"" Reuben replied. ""I can do any rough work as a smith or a carpenter, and I should think I ought to get my passage for my work. Anyhow, I have got twelve pounds saved up; and if I can't get out free, that and my work ought to take me.""  In a short time Mrs. Whitney, finding that Reuben was not to be shaken in his determination, ceased to oppose it; and began to busy herself in preparations for his departure, which he had arranged to take place as soon as possible.  A day or two before starting, he walked over to say goodbye to Mrs. Shrewsbury. He stopped as he passed the smithy and, seeing Jacob Priestley at work alone, he went in.  ""Ah, Reuben, is it you?"" the smith said. ""Better here than in the dock at Lewes, eh? I hears a talk of your going to foreign parts.""  ""Yes, I am off,"" Reuben said, ""and I have just come over to say goodbye to Mrs. Shrewsbury; so I looked in as I passed, knowing as you were one of those who found me not guilty, and would perhaps give me a shake of the hand, before leaving.""  ""That will I, lad. Yes, I found you not guilty; and I jest tipped you a wink, from the box, to let you know as it were all right; but my eye! what a game we had had of it. Never had such a game, in all my born days.""  And the blacksmith sat down on a stool, to indulge in a great fit of laughing.  ""What was the game?"" Reuben asked.  ""Well, you know, Stokes he was the foreman, and a Cockney sort of chap he be. He turns round in the box and, says he:  ""'In course you are all agreed.'  ""'Agreed as how?' says I.  ""'Why, agreed as he's guilty, in course,' says he.  ""'Nothing of the sort,' says I. 'I believes he's as innocent as a child unborn.'  ""Then they all comes round me and jaws; but seeing as I wasn't going to give in, Stokes he asked the judge for leave to retire.  ""Well, when we retires they all pitches into me, and says as it's monstrous one man should hold out agin eleven; and that, even if I didn't feel sure myself, I ought to go as the others went. So I didn't say much, but I sits myself down and brings out a big chunk of bread and bacon, as my good woman had put into my pocket, and I begins to eat.  ""'Look you here,' says I, 'I ha' got four parcels like this. Today be Friday, and I can hold on easy till Tuesday. That's how I looks at it. This young chap ain't had nothing to do with this 'ere robbery, and I ain't going to see he transported for what he never done.'  ""Well, there we sits. Sometimes they would all talk at once, sometimes two or three of them would give it me. Ten o'clock comes and they got desperate like, for only one or two of them had put anything into their pockets, thinking that the matter was sure to be finished that night. When the messages were sent out again, as we couldn't agree, I sits down in a corner and, says I:  ""'I ain't a selfish man, and any of you as changes your mind can have a share of what I have got.'  ""I dozes off, but I hears them jawing away among themselves. It might have been two o'clock when one of them comes to me and gives me a shake and, says he:  ""'Give us a cut of that bread and bacon. I am well-nigh starved. I have got a wife and children to think of, and it don't matter to me whether this chap goes to Botany Bay, or whether he don't. It didn't seem to me a certain case, all along, so I will go along with you.'  ""Gradually two or three more comes, and when it got light I could see as some more was hesitating so, says I:  ""'Lookee here, my friends. Those who has agreed to give this young chap another chance has lessened my stock of bread and bacon pretty considerable, and I ain't got more than enough for one more, so who's the next?'  ""Four more spoke out at once. I divides the bread and bacon among them; then, as there was nine of us agin three, we goes at them and tells them how wrong it is as we was all to suffer from their obstinacy, and we works on their feelings about their wives and children; and then, says I:  ""'I call it downright ridiculous, when there's a hot breakfast on twelve tables waiting for us, as three men should keep the rest from tucking in, just acause they won't give an innocent lad the benefit of the doubt.'  ""Well, that finished them. The thought of the hot breakfast made the other chaps so ravenous as I believe they would have pitched into Stokes and the other two, if they hadn't have given in. So they comes round, and we sends out to say that we had agreed on the vardict. It were the best game I ever seed in my life.""  ""Well, Jacob, I am sure I am heartily grateful to you, and I shall not forget your kindness; though what made you so sure of my innocence, while all the others doubted it, I don't know.""  ""Lor', Reuben!"" the smith said, ""There ain't nothing to thank me about. I didn't know nowght as to whether you was innocent or guilty; and it was a good job for me as I had made up my mind about that there vardict, afore I went into court; for I should never have made head or tail of all that talk, and the fellows with white hair on the top of their heads as kept bobbing up and down, and asking all sorts of questions, was enough to turn an honest man's head. The question was settled when Miss Kate Ellison--that's the little un, you know--came in here. Says she:  ""'Jacob, you are on this jury, I hear.'  ""'Yes, miss,' says I.  ""'Well, I hope you are going to find Reuben Whitney innocent,' says she.  ""'I don't know nothing about it,' says I. 'Folks seem to think as he did it.'  ""Then she went at me, and told me that she was sure you was innocent; and the squire he was sure, and he would be moighty put out if you was found guilty. So I told her natural that, the squire's being a good landlord, I wouldn't disoblige him on no account; and she might look upon it as good as settled that you should be found innocent. So she tells me not to say a word to anyone, and I ain't, not even to the ould woman; but in course, I don't consider as she meant you.""  Reuben could not help laughing as he learned that he had been acquitted, not from any belief in his innocence on the part of the jury, but by the intervention on his behalf of the girl who had, before, fought his battles. Shaking hands with Jacob, he went on to the schoolmaster's.  As he was sitting there chatting with Mr. and Mrs. Shrewsbury, he saw Kate Ellison come out of her father's gate along the road with her basket, as usual. Catching up his hat, he ran out and stood bareheaded, awaiting her.  ""Ah, Reuben!"" she said, with a smile and a nod, ""I am glad to see you before you go; for Mr. Shrewsbury told me, yesterday, you were going to leave Lewes and emigrate. I am glad,""--and she hesitated a little--""very glad that they found you innocent. I was quite sure you would not do such a thing.""  ""I am glad I came over today, Miss Ellison,"" Reuben said quietly. ""Very glad that I have met you; for I have just learned, from Jacob Priestley, that it is to you I am indebted that I am not, in the present moment, a prisoner in jail, under sentence of transportation.""  The girl flushed up hotly.  ""Jacob Priestley is very wrong to have spoken about it. I told him he was never to mention it.""  ""I hope you will not blame him, Miss Ellison. He told me he had never spoken a word to anyone else, but he thought you did not mean it to apply to me. I am very glad he has spoken; for I shall carry away with me, across the sea, a deep gratitude, which will last as long as I live, for the kindness you have shown me; not only now, but always--kindness which has saved me from a terrible punishment, for an offence of which I was innocent.  ""May God bless you, Miss Ellison, and render your life a happy one.""  ""Goodbye, Reuben,"" the girl said, gently. ""I hope you may do well, in the new land you are going to.""  So saying, she went on her errand. Reuben stood watching her, until she entered one of the cottages. Then, putting on his cap, he returned to the schoolmaster's.  A week later Reuben was wandering along the side of the London Docks, looking at the vessels lying there, and somewhat confused at the noise and bustle of loading and unloading that was going on. He had come up the night before by the carrier's waggon, and had slept at the inn where it stopped. His parting with his mother had been a very sad one, but Mrs. Whitney had so far come round as to own that she thought that his plan was perhaps the best; although she still maintained that she should never venture, herself, upon so distant a journey. He had promised that, should she not change her mind on this point, he would, whether successful or not, come home to see her.  The squire had driven over, the day before he left, to say goodbye to him. He had, through Mr. Shrewsbury, directly he heard that he was going, offered to help towards paying his passage money; but this offer Reuben had gratefully, though firmly, declined to accept.  ""Well, Reuben, I wish you every good luck on your adventure,"" he said. ""The place you are going to will be a great country, one of these days; and you are just the fellow to make your way in it. I am sorry you wouldn't let me help you; because I am in a way, you know, at the bottom of this business which has driven you from home.""  ""Thank you, squire, for your kind intention,"" Reuben answered; ""but I am so much in your debt, now, that I would rather not go further into it. I am old enough now to make my own way in life. My only regret in the matter is that I cannot persuade my mother to go with me.""  ""I think she is right, Reuben,"" the squire replied. ""You can transplant a young tree, easily enough; but you can't an old one. Somehow they won't take root in new soil.  ""Well, lad, I wish you every success. I suppose I shall hear through Shrewsbury, from time to time, how you are going on.""  As Reuben walked along the dock, he stopped to read the notices of their destination, affixed to the shrouds of most of the vessels. He had already gone on board three or four, which were loading for Australia, but in none was there a vacancy for a carpenter. He stopped before a fine-looking barque, to which no notice was attached.  ""Where is she going to?"" he asked a sailor, who was passing along the gangway to the shore.  ""She's bound for Sydney,"" the sailor said. ""She warps out of dock tonight, and takes on board a cargo of prisoners in the Medway.""  ""Do you mean men sentenced for transportation?"" Reuben asked.  ""Yes,"" the man said, ""and I wish she had any other sort of cargo. I have been out with such a load before, and I would as soon go with a cargo of wild beasts.""  Reuben felt a sudden chill, as he thought how narrow had been his escape of forming one of a similar party. However, he stepped on board, and went up to the mate, who was superintending the cargo.  ""Do you want a carpenter for the voyage out?""  ""A carpenter!"" the mate repeated. ""Well yes, we do want a carpenter. The man who was to have gone has been taken ill. But you are too young for the berth. Why, you don't look more than eighteen; besides, you don't look like a carpenter.""  ""I am a mill wright,"" Reuben said, ""and am capable of doing any ordinary jobs, either in carpentering or smith work. I have testimonials here from my late employers.""  ""Well, you can see the captain, if you like,"" the mate said. ""You will find him at Mr. Thompson's office, in Tower Street, Number 51.""  Reuben at once made his way to the office. The captain refused, at first, to entertain the application on the ground of his youth; but ship's carpenters were scarce, the time was short, and there was a difficulty in obtaining men for convict ships. Therefore, after reading the very warm testimonial as to character and ability which Mr. Penfold had given Reuben, he agreed to take him, on the terms of his working his passage.  Reuben went back at once, to the inn where he had stopped, and had his chest taken down to the docks; and went on board the Paramatta which, at high water, warped out of dock into the stream.    Chapter 6: On The Voyage.   The next day the Paramatta weighed anchor and proceeded down the river. Reuben had no time to look at the passing ships, for he was fully occupied with the many odd jobs which are sure to present themselves, when a ship gets under weigh. The wind was favourable, and the Paramatta ran down to the mouth of the Medway before the tide had ceased to ebb. She anchored for three hours, and then made her way up to Chatham, where she brought up close to the government yard.  It was not till late in the evening that Reuben had finished his work, and was at liberty to look round, and to take an interest in what was going on on deck.  ""This is your first voyage, my lad, I reckon,"" an old sailor, who was standing leaning against the bulwark, smoking his pipe, remarked.  ""Yes,"" Reuben said cheerfully, ""this is my first voyage. I have shipped as carpenter, you know, to work my way out to Sydney.""  ""You could not have chosen a better ship than this 'ere barkee,"" the sailor said; ""though I wish she hadn't got them convicts on board. She will sail all the faster, 'cause, you see, instead of being choked up with cargo, the deck below there has been set aside for them. That will make easy sailing and quick sailing; but I don't like them, for all that. They are a lot of trouble, and they has to be watched, night and day. There's never no saying what they might be up to; there's mostly trouble on board, with them. Then one can't help being sorry for the poor chaps, though they does look such a villainous bad lot. They are treated mostly like dogs, and I have been on board ships where the rations was not what a decent dog would look at.""  ""But I thought there was regular food, according to a scale,"" Reuben said.  ""Ay, there's that,"" the sailor replied, ""and the government officers see that the quantity's right; but, Lor' bless you! They don't trouble as to quality, and some of the owners buys up condemned stores, and such like; anything, thinks they, is good enough for a convict ship--biscuits as is dropping to pieces, salt junk as 'as been twenty years in cask, and which was mostly horse to begin with. No wonder as they grumbles and growls. A convict is a man, you see, though he be a convict; and it ain't in human nature to eat such muck as that, without growling.""  ""What tonnage is the vessel?"" Reuben asked.  ""'Leven hundred and fifty ton, and as fine and roomy a ship as there is in the trade, and well officered. I have made three v'yages with the captain and first mate, and the second mate was with us on the last v'yage.""  ""How many hands are there, altogether?""  ""Twenty-five, counting you as one, and not a-counting the two stewards.""  ""We are going to take some passengers, I see,"" Reuben said. ""I have been at work, putting up pegs and shelves for them.""  ""Yes, there's eight or ten passengers, I hears,"" the sailor said. ""Passengers don't mostly like going by convict ships, but then the fares are lower than by other vessels, and that tempts a few. Besides, the Paramatta is known to be a fast ship, and the skipper has a good name; so we shall have a better class of passengers, I expect, than usually voyages with convict ships; and besides the passengers there will be the officer of the convict guard, and a surgeon, so we shall be pretty full aft.""  ""And what will my duties be, when we are at sea?""  ""It just depends on the captain,"" the sailor said. ""You will be put in a watch, and work with the others, except that they may not send you aloft. That depends on the terms that you shipped.""  ""I shipped as carpenter, and to make myself generally useful, and to obey orders. I shall be happy to do anything I can; hard work is better than doing nothing, any day.""  ""That's the sort, my lad,"" the sailor said heartily. ""Now I am sail maker, but, bless your heart! Except putting a patch on a sail, now and then, there's nothing to do that way; and when not so wanted I am one of the ordinary crew. Still, if you works your passage, it ain't to be expected as they will drive you the same as a man as is paid. He's a fair man, is the skipper; and you won't find yourself put upon, on board the Paramatta.""  ""Can't I go up aloft now?"" Reuben asked. ""I would rather accustom myself to it while we are lying steady, than go up when the wind's blowing, and she is heeling over.""  ""Go up! To be sure you can, and I will go up with you, and tell you some of the names of the ropes, and put you up to things. There's a pleasure in helping a lad who seems in any way teachable. Some of they boys as comes on board a ship ain't worth their salt, in these days.""  The sailor led the way up the shrouds. Reuben found it much more difficult than it looked. He had seen the sailors running up and down, and it looked as easy as mounting a ladder; but the slackness of the ratlines--which, as the sailor told him, was the name of the pieces of rope which answered to the rounds of a ladder--made it at first awkward. When they reached the main top the sailor told him to sit down, and look round quietly, till he became accustomed to the height.  ""It looks unnatural and risky, at first,"" he said; ""but when you get accustomed to it, you will feel just as safe, when you are astraddle the end of a yard, and the ship rolling fit to take her masts out, as if you were standing on the deck.""  As Reuben had heard the sailors laughing and joking aloft, as they hauled out the earrings of the sails, he had no doubt that what the sailor said was true; but it seemed, to him, that he should never accustom himself to sit at the end of a spar, with nothing but the water at a vast depth below. It would be bad, even with the ship lying quiet, as at present. It would be terrible with the vessel in a heavy sea.  The sailor now told him the names of the masts and stays, giving him a general idea of the work aloft, and presently asked him whether he would like to return to the deck now, or to mount a bit higher. Although Reuben was now becoming accustomed to the position, he would, had he consulted his inner feelings, have rather gone down than up; but he thought it was better to put a good face on it, and to accustom himself, at once, to what he would probably have to do sooner or later.  Holding on tight then, and following the instructions of his companion, he made his way up until he was seated on the cap of the top-gallant mast, holding tight to the spar, which towered still higher above him. He was surprised at the size and strength of the spars, which had looked so light and slender, from below.  ""Very well done, lad,"" the sailor said approvingly. ""You would make a good sailor, in time, if you took to a seafaring life. There's not one in ten as would get up there, the first time of going aloft. You don't feel giddy, do you?""  ""No,"" Reuben replied, ""I don't think I feel giddy, but I feel a strange shaky feeling in my legs.""  ""That will soon pass off,"" the sailor said. ""You look at them hills behind the town, and the forts and works up there. Don't think about the deck of the vessel, or anything, but just as if you were sitting in a chair, watching the hills.""  Reuben did as the sailor instructed him and, as he did so, the feeling of which he was before conscious passed completely away.  ""I feel all right now,"" he said, after sitting quietly for a few minutes.  ""All right, then; down we go. Don't look below, but just keep your eyes in front of you, and never leave go of one grip till you make sure of the next.""  Five minutes later he stood on the deck.  ""Well done, my lad, for the first time,"" the first mate said, as Reuben put his foot on the deck ""I have had my eye on you. I shouldn't have let you go beyond the top, at the first trial; but I didn't think you would go higher, till you were fairly up, otherwise I should have hailed you from the deck.  ""You ought not to have taken him up above the top, Bill. If he had lost his head, it would have been all up with him.""  ""I could see he wasn't going to lose his head. Trust me for not leading a young hand into danger. He was a little flustrated, when he got into the top; but after he had sat down a bit, his breath come quiet and regular again, and I could see there was no chance of his nerve going.""  The next morning, soon after daybreak, the dockyard boats began to row alongside, with grey-coated convicts. Reuben watched them as they came on board, with a sort of fascination with their closely cut hair, bullet heads, and evil faces. Although he had no doubt that the repulsive expression was due partly to the close-cut hair and shaved faces, and their hideous garb, he could scarcely repress a shudder as he looked at them. In some faces an expression of brutal ferocity was dominant. Others had a shifty, cunning look, no less repulsive.  There were a few good-humoured faces, one or two so different from the others, that Reuben wondered whether they were innocent victims of circumstances, as he had so nearly been. Not till now did he quite realize how great his escape had been. The thought that he might have had to spend the rest of his life herding with such men as these, made him feel almost sick; and he thanked God more fervently, even, than he had done when the verdict was returned which restored him to his liberty, that he had been saved from such a fate.  A hundred and eighty convicts came on board. They were in charge of ten warders, with loaded muskets, and an hour later a party of twenty marines, under the charge of an officer, also embarked. They were on their way out to join a ship in Australian waters, and were to aid the warders in keeping the convicts in good order.  The wind being favourable, no time was lost after the marines had come on board. The moorings were cast off and sails hoisted, and the Paramatta made her way against the tide to the mouth of the Medway; and there dropped her anchor to wait until the tide began to ebb, for the wind was so light that little would have been gained by an attempt to proceed at once. Sail was made again as soon as tide turned and, on turning out next morning at daylight, for he had not yet been assigned to a watch, Reuben found that the ship was lying at anchor in the Downs.  Two or three hours passed.  ""What are we doing here, Bill?""  ""We are waiting for the passengers. They are all coming on board here. I expect that big lugger you see, running out direct for us, 'as got them on board.""  ""I wonder they didn't come on board when we started,"" Reuben said. ""I should think it would have been pleasanter than coming all the way down to Dover by coach.""  ""So I should think, my lad; but you see, it ain't every time as a ship has the luck we've had. It's a long job coming down to the Downs, if the wind don't serve. We might have been beating about there, at the mouth of the Thames, for a week. So you see, most of these 'longshore chaps like to send their traps on board while the vessel's in the docks, and then to come down here and stop till she comes round.""  In a few minutes the lugger was alongside, the gangway was lowered, and the passengers began to come on board. They were, as the sailor had said they would be, some ten in number. There were six men, four ladies, and three children, the latter not counting as regular passengers, as they were stowed away in their parents' cabins.  The convicts who were on deck looked over the bulwarks, and cracked coarse jokes among themselves, as the passengers ascended the gangway. Reuben found that only one-third of the number were allowed on deck at once. Two soldiers paced up and down the deck, on guard of the hatchway leading below, and two sentries were posted at other points.  A number of small boxes, bags, coats and cloaks were handed up, and then the rope was cast off, and the lugger made her way back to Dover, and the Paramatta again got under sail. While they had been waiting, the chief mate had told Reuben that, according to the captain's orders, he would henceforth be in his watch.  ""As you are not regularly shipped as a sailor,"" the mate said, ""the captain does not wish you to go aloft, unless by your own desire; but there will be plenty of work for you to do on deck, hauling at the braces, scrubbing, and so on.""  ""I should be glad to do my work with the rest,"" Reuben said, ""as soon as I feel I can be useful aloft. I was up two or three times yesterday, and hope in a few days to be quite accustomed to it.""  ""I have noticed you, my lad, and you could not be in better hands than Bill's. He is a capital sailor, and as he has taken to you, and you are willing to learn, you will be a useful hand before we get to Sydney; and even if you never go to sea again, all your life, you will find that you have learned a great deal that is useful on board the Paramatta.""  The fine weather, which the Paramatta had experienced so far, speedily left her. The sky grew overcast, and the wind freshened fast, and the next morning the ship was staggering, under close-reefed canvas, in the teeth of the southwesterly gale.  For the next three days Reuben made no advance in seamanship, being prostrated with seasickness. At times he crept out from the forecastle, and tried to lend a hand whenever he saw a party of men hauling at a rope; but the motion of the ship was so great that he could scarce keep his feet on the slippery decks, and at last the mate ordered him to go back to the forecastle, and remain there until he recovered somewhat from his sickness.  ""I see you are no skulker, my lad; but you will do no good on deck here, and are not unlikely to get a heavy fall, and perhaps a nasty hurt, so you had best lie off till you get over your sickness.""  Reuben was already drenched to the skin by the spray, and felt so weak that he was not sorry to avail himself of the mate's orders, and to turn in again to his bunk in the forecastle.  On the morning of the fourth day he felt himself again, and turned out. The gale had almost blown itself out, but the sea was very heavy. The fresh air was delightful to Reuben, after the confinement in the forecastle; and as his watch was on deck, he at once went up to Bill and asked him what he could do.  ""Glad to see you about agin, Reuben,"" the sailor said. ""You have had a worse time of it than most. There is a lot of difference atween chaps. Some takes it bad, and some is never ill from the first. Well, there ain't nothing to do at present, but just hold on and get to feel your legs. Don't you try to go across the deck, if the hands are called, until you are accustomed to it; else you will get a fall, to a certainty.""  ""Is the gale nearly over, Bill?""  ""Why, it's quite over. Don't you see that for yourself?""  ""It seems to me to blow hard now.""  ""Blow hard! Why, there ain't a capful of wind. It was blowing pretty hard yesterday, if you like, but not worth calling a gale. If you are lucky, you are like to know what a gale is, when we get south of the Cape. The wind does blow there, when it has made up its mind. That's the place where they say as the helmsman has to have two men, regular, to hold on his hair.""  Reuben laughed.  ""I think on the whole, Bill, I would rather get to Sydney without meeting a storm like that. This has been quite enough for me. Why, some of the waves hit the vessel's bow as if they would have knocked it in.""  ""Wait till you have a gale in earnest, Master Reuben, and you will know about it then. Of course it seemed worse to you, because you were lying there a-doing nothing, and was weak-like with heaving yourself up. If you had been on deck, you would have seen as it was nothing worth talking about.  ""Look at the ship. Everything's in its place, and ship-shape.""  ""Why, what has become of the tall spars aloft,"" Reuben said, looking up.  ""Oh, they were sent down when the wind freshened,"" Bill said. ""There ain't nothing in that.""  ""Where are the convicts, Bill?""  ""Oh, they are all battened down below,"" the sailor said carelessly. ""They only come up for an airing when the weather is fine. They are like the passengers only, instead of pleasing themselves, their ways are marked out for them.""  ""Have any of the passengers been up?""  ""Two or three of the men have shown, and a gal. It ain't her first voyage, I'll bet. A pretty thing she is, and as straight as a mast. She's been on deck, off and on, ever since we started.""  The next morning the sea moderated greatly and, the wind having gone round to the southeast, the Paramatta made the most of it, to get west as far as possible before turning her head to the south.  ""That's a slice of luck,"" Bill Hardy said to Reuben; ""there's nothing like getting well off, at the start. With luck, now, we oughtn't to see the land till we make the Cape.""  ""But I would rather see the land, Bill. When one is going half round the globe, it is pleasant to touch at ports on the way, and to get a glimpse at foreign peoples and ways.""  ""Ay, I like a spree on shore,"" Bill agreed; ""but after all, it don't last long; and when you are near land, there's always the chance that the wind may shift round, and you may find yourself dead on a lee shore. The skipper gets anxious and the mates out of temper, and if it does come on to blow hard, from the wrong quarter, there's never no saying what will come of it.  ""No, my lad, there's nothing like a good open sea, with no land within five hundred miles of you, at the least. The coast of Africa ain't a pleasant neighbour. What with the low shores, which you don't see till you are pretty nigh close to them; what with the currents and the changeable winds, and the precious bad lookout there is, if you do get cast ashore, I tell you the wider berth you gives it, the better.""  The next morning was so fine and bright that all the passengers were on deck, and after breakfast the word was passed forward that the carpenter was wanted. Reuben found that he was wanted to nail some strips of wood on the floor of some of the cabins, to prevent the boxes from shooting out from under the berths when the vessel rolled. As he was at work at one of these, a young lady came to the door of the cabin, and uttered a little exclamation of surprise at seeing Reuben kneeling on the floor. Then, seeing what he was doing, she said:  ""Oh, you are the carpenter, I suppose?""  ""Yes, miss.""  ""I wish you would screw on some pegs I brought with me, to hang things upon. Everything does get thrown about so, when the ship's rolling. They are in that trunk, if you will not mind pulling it out.""  Reuben pulled out the trunk, which the girl opened and, after some search, produced half-a-dozen iron clothes pegs. She showed him where she wished them screwed on, and stood looking on while he carried out her instructions.  ""Are you the ship's carpenter?""  ""Yes, miss.""  ""You seem very young for a carpenter, don't you?""  ""I am young,"" Reuben replied, smiling, ""and this is my first voyage. Fortunately for me, the hand who was engaged hurt himself, just as the vessel was sailing, so I obtained the berth. So far it does not appear that it is a difficult one.""  The girl looked at him a little curiously. His manner of talk and conversation differed, so much, from the sailors in general.  ""Are you really a carpenter?"" she asked. ""You don't look like a carpenter.""  ""Yes, I am really a carpenter,"" Reuben answered; ""at least, I am a mill wright by trade. We are a sort of half and half between carpenter and smith.  ""Is there anything else?"" he asked, as he finished screwing the last screw.  ""No, nothing else, thank you,"" the girl answered. ""That will do very nicely, and I am much obliged to you.""  After finishing his work in the cabins, Reuben went forward.  ""Captain,"" the young lady said, as she went upon deck, ""I have been talking to that young carpenter of yours. I am quite interested in him. Is he really a carpenter? He does not talk a bit like one.""  ""I believe so, Miss Hudson,"" the captain replied. ""At least, he produced an excellent testimonial from his last employer, when I engaged him. Of course, it might not have been genuine. If there had been time, I should have made more inquiries; but he was well spoken, and had an earnest look about him. But, now you mention it, I don't know that it is very wise letting him go into all the cabins, when I know so little about him.""  ""Oh, I never thought of that!"" the girl exclaimed. ""I am sure he looks honest. It was only because he spoke so well that I mentioned it.""  ""He seems to be a sharp young fellow,"" the captain remarked, ""and I see that he has taken to going aloft with the rest of the crew already. He is an emigrant rather than a sailor, for he has only shipped for a passage. I don't know whether he is going to join a man, out there; but if not, he is certainly young to go out on his own account. I do not think he's more than eighteen. He looks so young, he cannot have served all his time at his trade.""  ""I really feel quite interested in him, Captain Wilson,"" the girl said, turning to a gentleman standing by, who had been listening to the conversation. ""I wish, if you get an opportunity, you would get into conversation with this carpenter of ours, and find out something about him.""  ""I will, if you like, Miss Hudson; but I don't suppose there's much to find out, and what there is, he's not likely to tell me. From what you say, I should guess that he had had a bad master, and had run away.""  ""But the captain said he had good testimonials,"" Miss Hudson persisted.  ""As to testimonials,"" the gentleman said, ""anyone can write a testimonial.""  ""How suspicious you are, Captain Wilson!"" the girl laughed. ""That's the worst of being a police officer, and having to do with criminals. You think whoever you come across is a rogue, until you find out he is an honest man. Now, I think everyone is honest, till I find him out to be a rogue.""  ""My way is the safest,"" the officer laughed. ""At any rate, on board this ship there are five rogues to each honest man.""  ""Ah, but that's not a fair average,"" the girl objected. ""Of course, in the colony one has to be careful, considering that half the shepherds and stockmen are convicts, and I must own that the natives are nearly all thieves; but how could it be otherwise, when England sends all its rogues out to us? You see, when free labour gets more abundant, and we can do without convicts, the colonists will protest against it.""  ""Very likely they will,"" the officer agreed; ""but what is England to do, if she has nowhere to send her rogues?""  ""That is her business,"" Miss Hudson said carelessly. ""There is no reason why they should be shoved on to us. In the old time, when there were no colonies, England managed somehow, and I suppose she could do so again.""  ""She managed in a very short way,"" Captain Wilson said. ""She hung them as fast as she caught them. It did not matter much what the offence was, whether stealing a loaf or killing a man; but she could hardly go back to that, now.""  ""No, she could not,"" Miss Hudson agreed; ""but I have no doubt she can find something useful for them to do, when she has to keep them at home.  ""Don't you think so, captain?""  ""I daresay she could,"" the captain answered. ""Certainly, if I were a colonist living in a lonely part of the country, I should object to transportation for, what with the natives and bush rangers and bad characters generally, no one can say their life is safe.""  ""Oh, it's not so bad as that, captain!"" Miss Hudson said indignantly. ""You are giving the place a bad character.""  ""I think Captain Wilson will agree it's a true one,"" the captain said, smiling.  ""Eh, Captain Wilson?""  ""I am afraid so,"" the latter replied. ""I know they keep me pretty busy. However, after a year's holiday, I must not grumble if I find plenty to do when I get there.""  The voyage down to the Cape was wholly uneventful. The Paramatta was most fortunate in her weather and, beyond trimming the sails, the crew had a very easy time of it. Captain Wilson had, as he promised Miss Hudson, taken the opportunity, when Reuben was sitting idly on deck, of having a chat with him; but he did not learn much in the course of the conversation.  ""Your young carpenter puzzles me, Miss Hudson,"" he said to her at dinner. ""He is certainly an altogether exceptionally well-spoken young fellow, for his condition of life; but I can't quite make him out. I think that he has worked as a mill wright. He spoke openly and without hesitation as to his work. But how it is he has thrown it up and emigrated, so young, I can't make out. Of course he cannot have served his time and yet, somehow, I don't think that he has run away, from the manner in which he spoke of his employer.  ""He has no friends whatever in the colony, as far as I could learn. I should say he has certainly been fairly educated, and yet he seems, from his own account, to have worked three or four years at his trade.  ""I certainly like the lad, though I own that, so far, I cannot altogether make him out. Perhaps I shall learn somewhat more about him, before we get to the end of the voyage, and in that case I will tell you all I know.""  Miss Hudson was the daughter of a wealthy flock owner--or, as he was called, squatter--in New South Wales. Her father and mother were on board the ship with her. This was her fifth voyage. She had gone out as a baby with her parents; and had returned to England, at the age of ten, to be educated. When eighteen, she had joined her mother and father in Australia and, two years later, had come with them to Europe, and had spent some months travelling on the Continent. They were now on their way back to the colony.  The only other single lady among the passengers of the Paramatta was going out, under the charge of the captain, to fill a place as governess in a family in Sydney. Miss Furley was somewhat quiet, but a friendship had naturally sprang up between her and Miss Hudson, as the only two young women on board the ship; and the life and high spirits of the young colonist, and the musical acquirements of Miss Furley, helped to make the voyage pass pleasantly for the passengers in the Paramatta.  Captain Wilson had a good tenor voice, and sang well; and one of the other passengers was able to furnish a bass. Almost every evening, as the ship was running down the tropics before a gentle favouring breeze, the sound of solo and glee singing rose from the little party gathered on the poop; and even the convicts, on deck forward, ceased their talk and listened to the strains.  Although the passage had been a pleasant one, there was a general feeling of satisfaction when the ship dropped her anchor in Table Bay. Most of the passengers went on shore at once, to take up their quarters at the hotel till she sailed again. The captain said that it would take at least a couple of days to fill up the water tanks, and take in a supply of fresh provisions.  On the afternoon of the second day, Reuben asked permission of the first mate to go ashore for a few hours.  ""Certainly, Whitney,"" the officer said. ""You have proved a very useful hand on the way out, which is more than most do who work their passage. Nine out of ten of them are not worth their salt, to say nothing of the rest of their rations. You can stay on shore tonight, if you like; but you must come off early in the morning. We hope to get away in good time.""  On landing, Reuben was much struck with the variety of the scene. In the streets of Cape Town were men of many types. Here was the English merchant and man of business, looking and dressing just as he would at home. Names over the shop doors were for the most part Dutch, as was the appearance of the majority of the white men in the streets. Dutch farmers in broad hats and homespun garments, mounted on rough ponies, clattered along through the streets. The manual work was for the most part done by swarthy natives, while among the crowd were numbers of Malays, with dark olive skins, small eyes, and jet-black hair, their women being arrayed in every shade of gaudy colour.  For some time Reuben wandered about the streets, greatly amused at all he saw. Towards evening he turned his face towards the sea, as he had no wish to avail himself of the permission given him to sleep on shore. Presently he encountered Miss Hudson and Miss Furley, walking the other way. The former nodded brightly, for she had several times spoken to Reuben, since their first acquaintanceship.  Reuben touched his hat, and proceeded on his way. He had gone but a few yards when he heard a loud cry, and everyone darted suddenly into shops or round corners.  Looking round in surprise, Reuben saw what had caused the movement. A Malay, with his long hair streaming down his shoulders, was rushing down the street, giving vent to terrible yells; in his hand he held a crease, with which, just as Reuben looked round, he cut down a native who had tried, too late, to make his escape.  The two English girls, confused and alarmed at the sudden outburst; and unable, until too late, to comprehend the cause of it, stood alone in the middle of the street and, too terrified now to move, clung to each other, regardless of the shouts to fly raised by people at the windows and doors.  [Illustration: The Ladies Saved from the Malay's Crease.]  The Malay, with a howl of exultation, made at them with uplifted crease. Reuben sprang forward, passed the terrified women when the Malay was within four paces of them, and threw himself with all his force upon him. The Malay, whose eyes were fixed upon the ladies, was taken by surprise by the assault; and his crease had not time to fall when Reuben sprang upon him.  The shock threw both to the ground; Reuben, as he fell, throwing both arms round his adversary. The Malay struggled furiously, and the combatants rolled over and over on the ground. Strong as Reuben was, the frenzy of the Malay gave him greater power; and the lad felt he could not long retain his grip of the arm with which the Malay strove to use his crease.  Help, however, was not long in coming. A native policeman ran up at full speed; and brought his heavy club, with his full force, down on the head of the Malay. The latter's limbs at once relaxed, and Reuben sprang to his feet; breathless, but not seriously harmed, although the blood was freely flowing from some slight wounds he had received from the Malay's sharp-edged weapon.    Chapter 7: Gratitude.   Reuben looked round, upon gaining his feet. He saw Miss Hudson standing by the side of her companion; who had fallen, fainting, to the ground. Mr. Hudson and Captain Wilson, running at their full speed, were within a few paces of the girls. They had entered a shop to make a purchase, while the ladies strolled on; and although they had rushed out on hearing the alarm, they were too far off to render assistance and, impotent to help, had seen with horror the terrible death which threatened the ladies.  Frances Hudson had not uttered a word, from the moment when the Malay rushed down upon them; but as her father came up she turned round, and burst into tears as he clasped her in his arms.  As soon as it was seen that the Malay was no longer dangerous, the people poured out again from the houses and shops. It was no very unusual thing, in Cape Town, for the Malays to run amuck; and many of those in the streets hurried off, in the direction from which the man had come, to inquire how many victims had fallen to his deadly crease, and to see whether any friends were among them. On the Malay himself no one spared a moment's attention. A second tremendous blow, with the policeman's club, had dashed out his brains; for Malays running amuck were always killed upon the spot, partly in order to save further trouble with them, partly to strike terror into others.  Many of the bystanders gathered round Reuben, seized him by the hand, patting him on the shoulder, and praising him for the courage with which he had faced the maddened savage. A minute later, Mr. Hudson forced his way through the crowd. Miss Furley had already been raised, and carried into a shop.  ""Go in with her, my dear,"" Mr. Hudson said to his daughter. ""I will bring him to you directly.  ""My brave fellow!"" he exclaimed, as he made his way to Reuben and grasped his hand, ""how can I thank you for saving my child's life? It seemed to us that she was lost, and that nothing could save her; when we saw you dash past her, and throw yourself unarmed upon the madman. It was a noble deed, indeed.  ""You are not badly hurt, I hope,"" he added, as he saw the blood streaming down Reuben's face and arm.  ""Nothing to speak of, sir,"" Reuben replied. ""At least, I think not; but I feel rather queer from this loss of blood. I had better get myself bandaged up.""  And indeed, Reuben was turning very pale, partly from the relaxation of the tension of the struggle; partly, as he said, from loss of blood.  ""Stand back!"" Mr. Hudson cried, ""don't press upon him. The lad is nearly fainting. One of you help me get him into a shop. Where is the nearest surgeon to be found?""  It was as much as Reuben could do to walk across the street, aided by his two supporters. A strong glass of Cape smoke (as the native spirit is called) and water revived him somewhat. It was some minutes before a surgeon arrived; for five persons had been terribly wounded, and two killed by the Malay on his course, and the surgeons near were busily employed.  ""Not very serious,"" the surgeon said, as soon as he examined Reuben's wounds. ""Very different affairs from those I have just come from.""  ""I had hold of his hand,"" Reuben said, ""so that he couldn't strike. They are only cuts he made in trying to get his arm free.""  ""That on your arm will not trouble you, though it has bled pretty freely. The one down your face is, fortunately, of no great consequence; except that it has cut down to the bone on the brow and cheek. If it had been an inch further back, it would have severed the temporal artery. You have had a narrow escape of it. As it is, you will get off with a scar, which may last for some time; but as it is an honourable one, perhaps you won't so much care. However, I will bring it together as well as I can, and stitch it up, and it may not show much.""  The wound was sewn up and then bandaged, as was that on the arm. The other and slighter wounds were simply drawn together by slips of plaster. When all was done, Reuben said to Mr. Hudson:  ""I shall do very well now, sir. I am sure you must wish to go to Miss Hudson. I will sit here a bit longer, and then go on board the ship.""  ""You will do nothing of the kind,"" Mr. Hudson said. ""I have just sent for a vehicle, and you will come to the hotel and get into bed at once. You are not fit to stand now, but I hope a good night's rest will do you good.""  Reuben would have protested, but at this moment a vehicle arrived at the door, and with it Captain Wilson entered.  ""I have just taken your daughter and Miss Furley to the hotel, Hudson,"" he said. ""They are both greatly shaken, and no wonder. So I thought it better to see them back, before coming in to shake hands with our gallant young friend here.""  ""He has lost a good deal of blood, Wilson; and I am just taking him off, to get him to bed in the hotel.  ""So we won't do any thanking till the morning,"" Mr. Hudson said, seeing that Reuben's lip quivered, and he was incapable of bearing any further excitement. ""Do you take one of his arms and I will take the other, and get him into that trap.""  A quarter of an hour later, Reuben was in bed at the hotel. Mr. Hudson brought him up a basin of clear soup. Having drunk this, he turned over and was, in a very few minutes, asleep. The captain and most of the other passengers were at the same hotel, and there was great excitement when the news arrived of the terrible danger the two girls had run. Mrs. Hudson had, from her early life, been accustomed to emergencies; and the instant the girls arrived she took them up to the room they shared between them, and insisted upon their going at once to bed, after partaking of a cup of tea.  ""What am I to do for this young fellow, Wilson?"" Mr. Hudson asked as, having seen his patient comfortably in bed, he returned downstairs, and took a seat in the verandah by his fellow passenger. ""I owe Frances' life to him, and there is nothing I wouldn't do for him. The question is, what? One does not like to offer money to a man, for such a service as this.""  ""No,"" Mr. Wilson agreed, ""especially in his case. The young fellow appears to me very much above his condition. Your daughter first pointed it out to me, and I have since chatted with him several times, and find him a very superior young fellow. Certainly his education has been very different from that of most men in his condition of life, and I should have taken him for a gentleman, who had got into some scrape and run away, had it not been that he seems to have been regularly apprenticed to his trade. Still, there is something a little mysterious about him. I asked him casually what part of the country he came from. He hesitated a moment, and then said, 'From the south of England.' Of course, I did not ask any further questions, as it was clear he did not care about naming the precise locality, or he would not have given so vague an answer. I feel as deeply indebted to him as you do.""  Mr. Hudson nodded. Only the evening before arriving at Cape Town, Captain Wilson had spoken to him on the matter of his affection for his daughter, and had asked his permission to speak to Frances. They had known each other in the colony, but had not been intimate until thrown together on board the Paramatta. Seeing that she was an only child, and that her father was considered one of the wealthiest squatters in the colony, Captain Wilson had feared that Mr. Hudson would not approve of him as a suitor; and had therefore broached the subject to him, before speaking to her. Mr. Hudson, however, had raised no objections.  ""You have taken a manly and proper course, in speaking to me first,"" he said; ""just what I should have expected from you. I own that, with the fortune the girl will have some day, I have always looked for her making what they call a good match, and settling down in the old country; but I may tell you that while she has been in Europe she has had several opportunities of so doing, if she would have taken them. She did not think fit to do so, and I have always made up my mind not to influence her in any way, providing she didn't fix her choice upon one whose character I disapproved. Certainly I have no reasons for so doing, in the present case. Your character stands high in the colony; and personally, as you are well aware, I like you exceedingly.  ""What Frances' feelings in the matter are, I have no means of knowing. There is no doubt she likes you, but as to anything more, it is for you to find out. You will have plenty of time, between this and Sydney. Anyhow, you have my hearty approval of your wooing.  ""I think, between ourselves you know, you must not expect, at first, any very cordial approval on the part of her mother. She had an idea, you know, that Frances would marry a duke at least, and an offer from a prince of the blood would not have surprised her. It is a great disappointment, to her, that she should have returned unmarried; and she has already been talking to me about our returning to England, in another couple of years. So she will not take quite kindly to it, at first; but you mustn't mind that. Fond of Frances as she is, she will soon come round, if she finds that the girl's happiness is really concerned in the matter.  ""Take my advice, and don't push it till we get near the end of the voyage. If Frances says yes, she is the sort of girl to stick to it; and as I am with you, you may be quite sure it will come right in the long run; but we might not have a very pleasant time of it during the remainder of the voyage, you know, and as things have gone on so pleasantly, it would be a pity to spoil them.""  Thus it was that Mr. Hudson nodded, when the young officer of the constabulary said that his indebtedness to Reuben was equal to his own.  ""Yes,"" he said, ""if it had been one of the sailors, I could have set the matter right by drawing a big cheque, and I shouldn't have cared how big; but with this young fellow I do not quite see my way. However, I will shift the responsibility, by leaving the matter in Frances' hands--women are much better hands at things of this sort, that require a light touch, than we are. I do not wonder that she and Miss Furley are shaken. I feel shaken myself. I shall never forget that scene, and the two girls standing there, and that wild Malay rushing at them. My legs seemed to give way under me, and I thought I should have fallen down.""  ""I felt bad myself, sir,"" Captain Wilson said. ""I have been in some tough fights, with bush rangers and natives; but I never had that sort of feeling before.  ""One ran, but one felt it was no use running, as all must be over before we could get there. When it was over, I felt as weak as a child.""  ""Don't let us talk any more about it,"" Mr. Hudson said, rising. ""I doubt whether I shall get a wink of sleep now; and I am sure I sha'n't, if we go on talking any more about it. Let us take a turn, and have a stiff glass of brandy and water afterwards, to settle our nerves before turning in.""  The passengers by the Paramatta were up early in the morning, for the ship was to sail at nine. But early as they were, Reuben was before them; and on Mr. Hudson inquiring about him, as he turned out, he was informed that he had already gone on board the ship.  The two girls both looked pale, when they came down to their early breakfast. Both declared, however, that they had slept well.  ""You must give us time, dad, to get up our roses,"" Frances Hudson said, in reply to her father's remarks as to their appearance. ""I have no doubt a few days at sea will do it; but of course, it is only right and proper that young ladies should be pale, after going through such an adventure as we had yesterday.  ""But do not let us talk about it,"" she said, with a shudder. ""I should like not to be able to think about it, again, for six months. You used to say, dad, that I was plucky, because I wasn't afraid of wild cattle, and not very afraid of the natives or bush rangers; but I am sure I cannot lay claim to any special courage in future, for no one in the world could feel more frightened than I did, yesterday.""  ""Well, my dear, you were no worse than anyone else, for everyone else bolted at the first alarm. The way that street was cleared was something marvellous.""  ""Yes, dad; but I was too frightened to run. Not that it would have been any use if I had, for he was close to us before we knew what was the matter; and if I could have run, I don't think Emma could.""  ""No, indeed,"" Miss Furley said. ""I had no idea of running and, even had there been plenty of time, I am sure I could not have got out of the way. Somehow I seemed to lose all power to move. I had just shut my eyes, and thought it was all over, when there was a shout and a rush, and I saw the Malay roll over; and then I made a snatch at Frances, and rolled over, too.""  ""It was a terrible moment,"" Mr. Hudson said. ""But I agree, with Frances, that it is better for you to try and think nothing more about it, until you have perfectly recovered your health and spirits.""  ""I hear, dad, that the young man that saved us has gone on board ship. I asked, directly I was up, because I wanted to see him.""  ""And I expect, my dear, that he slipped away because he didn't want to see you. It sounds rude, doesn't it? But I can perfectly understand it.""  ""So can I,"" the girl agreed. ""Did you see him this morning?""  ""No, my dear. I came downstairs only a minute or two before you did, and then found that he was gone.""  ""Have you thought over what you are going to do, dad, for him?""  ""Wilson and I have talked it over, Frances, but at present we don't see our way. It is too serious a matter to make up our minds in a hurry. Your mother is in favour of giving him a handsome present; but I don't think, myself, that that would do. Men who will do such deeds as that are not the sort of men to be paid by money.""  ""Oh no, dad! Surely not that. Any other possible way, but not money.""  ""No, my dear; so I thought. I have chatted it over with Wilson, and we have agreed that the best plan is to leave it entirely in your hands.""  ""I will think it over, dad,"" the girl said gravely. ""It is a serious thing. We owe him our lives, and the least we can do is not to hurt his feelings, by the way in which we try to show our gratitude.""  Reuben had slept well; and on waking, soon after daylight, jumped at once out of bed; and was glad to feel that, except for a certain amount of weakness in the legs, and stiffness in his wounds, he was all right again. He dressed quietly and, as soon as he heard persons moving about in the hotel, made his way down to the shore, and sat down there to wait for a boat from the ship; which was lying some distance out, and would, he was sure, be sending off early, as there would be many things to bring on board before she sailed.  It was not long before he saw the men descending the gangway to the boat alongside, which was soon rowing towards the shore. As she approached, Reuben saw the steward and first mate, sitting in the stern seats; and when the officer jumped ashore, his eye fell on Reuben.  ""Ah, Whitney,"" he said, ""I am glad to see you about. When the captain came off, last night, he told me all about your gallant rescue of the two ladies. I am sorry to see you bandaged up so much. The captain said you had some nasty cuts, but I didn't think they were so bad.""  ""They are nothing to speak about, sir,"" Reuben replied, ""although you would think so, from seeing those bandages all over one side of the face, and my arm in a sling; but they are no great depth, and don't hurt to speak of. They were clean cuts with a sharp edge, and don't hurt half as much as many a knock I have had, with a hammer.""  ""Well, we all feel proud of you, my lad. It isn't everyone who would face a Malay running amuck, without weapons, I can tell you.""  ""I think any English sailor would do so, sir, if he saw the Malay rushing down upon two ladies. There was no time to think about danger, one way or the other. The only thing to be done was to rush at him, and so I rushed, as anyone else would have done.""  ""Ah, it's all very well to say so, Whitney; but I have my doubts about everyone else rushing. However, I mustn't stand talking about it now, as I have my hands full of work. The sooner you get on board the ship, the better.  ""Row Whitney back to the ship, lads, and come back again in an hour's time. None of the things will be down here before that.""  Reuben stepped into the boat, which at once pushed off. The men rowed easily, for they were anxious to hear the particulars of the report which had circulated through the ship. Bill Hardy was rowing the stroke oar, and did the questioning.  ""You may try to make little of it,"" he said, ""but I tell you, Reuben, it were a right down good thing--a thing any man would have right to be proud of.  ""What do you say, mates?""  There was a general chorus of ""Ay, ay.""  ""I took you in hand when you came on board, young un,"" Bill went on, ""and I looks upon you as my chick, and I tell you I feel proud on you. I felt sure you would turn out a good un, some day, but I didn't look to see it so quick.  ""In oars!""  The boat ran up alongside the gangway, and Reuben was soon upon deck. He was there met by the captain, who had just come up as the boat rowed alongside. He shook Reuben's hand heartily.  ""You are a fine young fellow, Whitney; and your mother, if you have one, ought to be proud of you. I should be, if you were a son of mine. It was a lucky day for us all, when I shipped you on board the Paramatta; for it would have been a heavy day for us, if those two young ladies had been killed by that madman, yesterday.  ""You look pale, lad, as much as one can see of you, and you will have to lie by for a bit. I hear you lost a great deal of blood.  ""Steward, bring another cup of cocoa with mine, a large one, and put plenty of milk in.""  The captain insisted on Reuben coming to his cabin to drink his cocoa.  ""You had best knock off your allowance of spirits, till your wounds have healed up, lad. I will tell the second mate to serve you out port wine, instead.""  Reuben now went forward, feeling very much the better for the cocoa. He again had to receive the hearty congratulations of the men; and then, rather to escape from this than because he felt he needed it, he turned into his bunk, and was soon sound asleep.  Three hours later, he was awakened by the tramp of men overhead, and knew that they were shortening the anchor chain, and preparing to be off. Going out on to the deck, he saw that the courses had been dropped, and the topsails were lying loose in their gaskets. The crew were singing merrily, as they worked the capstan. Three of the boats already hung from the davits, and two large boats were bringing off the passengers, and were already within a hundred yards of the ship; while the remaining ship's boat, with the steward, crowded with fresh stores, was but a short way behind them. As soon as the passengers were up, and the shore boats had left, she came alongside.  ""Hook on the falls at once,"" the first mate ordered, ""and run her up as she is. You can get the things out afterwards.""  The anchor was, by this time, under the foot.  ""Up with it, lads!"" and the sailors again started, at full speed, on the capstan.  The jibs were run up, the courses and topsails shaken out and braced, and the Paramatta began to steal through the water again, for the second portion of her voyage. Mr. Hudson and his friend very soon made their way forward, and the ship was scarcely under way when Reuben, who was gazing over the bulwark at the shore, felt a hand laid on his shoulder.  ""How are you today, Reuben? Better, I hope? It was too bad of you to run off in that way, this morning.""  ""I am all right now, thank you, sir,"" Reuben answered. ""I felt just a little shaky at first, but the captain gave me a cup of cocoa when I came on board, and I feel now as if I were fit for duty again.""  ""Oh, nonsense,"" Mr. Hudson exclaimed, ""you mustn't think of work, for days yet. No, you must come aft with me. My daughter and Miss Furley are most anxious to see you; and my wife, too, is longing to add her thanks to mine.""  ""You are very good, sir, but really I would rather not, if you will excuse me. It is horrid being thanked and made a fuss about, just because, on the spur of the moment, one did one's duty.""  ""That's all very well, Reuben; but you see, it wouldn't be fair to my daughter. If anyone did you a great service, you would want to thank them, would you not?""  ""Yes, I suppose so, sir,"" Reuben answered reluctantly; ""but really, I hate it.""  ""I can understand your feelings, my lad, but you must make up your mind to do it. When anyone puts others under a vast obligation to him, he must submit to be thanked, however much he may shrink from it. Come along, it will not be very dreadful.""  Reuben saw that there was no getting out of it, and followed Mr. Hudson along the deck; feeling, however, more ashamed and uncomfortable even than he did when standing in the dock, as a criminal. Captain Wilson walked beside him. Hitherto he had not spoken, but he now laid his hand quietly upon Reuben's shoulder.  ""My lad,"" he said, ""I am not a man to talk much; but believe me that, henceforth, I am your friend for life.""  Reuben looked up, with a little smile which showed that he understood. He had often, indeed, watched the young officer and Miss Hudson together, and had guessed that they were more than mere acquaintances.  The passengers were, with the exception of the three ladies, all gathered on the poop. But Frances had proposed to her mother that they should see Reuben in the cabin alone, as she felt that it would be a severe ordeal, to the lad, to be publicly thanked. Captain Wilson ascended to the poop and joined the others there, while Mr. Hudson went alone into the cabin.  The three ladies were awaiting him there. Frances came forward first. The tears were standing in her eyes.  ""You have saved my life,"" she said softly, ""at the risk of your own; and I thank you with all my heart, not only for my own sake, but for that of my father and mother; who would have been childless, today, had it not been for you.""  ""I need no thanks, Miss Hudson,"" Reuben said quietly.  His shyness had left him, as he entered the cabin.  ""It will, all my life, be a source of pleasure and gratification to me, that I have been able to have been of service to so bright and kind a lady.""  ""I am not less grateful,"" Miss Furley said, advancing also. ""I shall never forget that dreadful moment, and the feeling which darted through my mind, as you rushed past us and threw yourself upon him, and I felt that I was saved almost by a miracle.""  ""And you must accept my thanks also,"" Mrs. Hudson said; ""the thanks of a mother, whose child you have saved from so dreadful a death. Believe me that there is nothing that my husband or myself would not do, to show how deeply and sincerely we are grateful to you.""  Mrs. Hudson, indeed, felt rather aggrieved that she could not, at once, take some active steps towards rewarding the young man for saving her daughter's life; and she had been unable to understand the scruples of her husband and daughter on the subject. It was only, indeed, at their urgent entreaty that she had given way on this point.  ""I call it monstrous, Frances,"" she said, almost angrily. ""Of course the young man will expect something more substantial than words. It is only natural that we should reward him for preserving your life, and it would be a crime if we didn't do so. Of course, he didn't do it for money at the time, but it is absurd to suppose that a young carpenter like this, working his way out on board a ship, will object to receive a handsome present for such a service as this. Our feelings have a right to be considered, as well as his; and a nice thing it will be, for people to say that Ralph Hudson and his wife were so stingy, and ungrateful, that they did nothing for the lad who had saved their daughter's life.""  ""There is no fear of their saying that, mother. Everyone in the colony knows that there are no more open-handed people in New South Wales than you and my father. Besides, I do not say that we are to do nothing for him. On the contrary, I agree with you that it would be wrong, indeed, if we did not. I only say, please don't let there be a word said about reward, now. Let us thank him as one would thank a gentleman, who had done us a great service.""  ""Of course, I will do as your father wishes, Frances, but I call it nonsense. If he were a gentleman it would, of course, be different; but he is a young carpenter and, though you won't see it, that seems to me to make all the difference.""  ""From what I have seen of him, mother,"" Frances persisted, ""I am sure that he has the feelings of a gentleman; even if he is not one by birth, about which I am not certain. Anyhow, I am much obliged to you for letting me have my own way.""  ""You always do have your own way, Frances,"" her mother laughed. ""You get round your father first, and then you come to me, and what can I do against the two of you?""  Reuben briefly answered Miss Furley and Mrs. Hudson; and Mr. Hudson, feeling that the lad would rather get over the scene as soon as possible, slipped his arm though his and said:  ""Now, Reuben, you must just come up for a minute on the poop. The other passengers are all waiting to shake you by the hand, and they would not forgive me if I were to let you run off, as I know you are wanting to do, without a word.""  Accordingly Reuben was taken up to the poop, where the passengers all shook hands with him, and congratulated him upon his courage.  ""Now, I suppose I can go, sir,"" he said, with a smile to Mr. Hudson, when this was over.  ""Yes, you can go now,"" Mr. Hudson laughed. ""Most young fellows at your age would be glad of an opportunity for figuring as a hero, but you talk as if it was one of the most painful businesses imaginable.""  ""Anyhow, I am glad it's over, Mr. Hudson, I can assure you; and now, I think I will turn in again. Considering what a night I had, I feel wonderfully sleepy.""  It was not until the sun was setting that Reuben appeared again on deck. Shortly after he did so, Captain Wilson strolled up to the place where he was standing.  ""I wish, Reuben,"" he said, after a few remarks on other subjects, ""that you would tell me a little more about yourself. You understand that I do not ask from mere inquisitiveness; but after what has happened, you see, we seem to have got into close relationship with each other; and if I knew more about you, I could the easier see in what way I could most really be useful to you, out there. Are you what you appear to be?""  ""I am, indeed,"" Reuben replied, with a smile. ""My history is a very simple one. My father was a miller with a good business and, up to the age of ten, it did not appear that I should ever be working as a craftsman for my living. Unhappily, at that time my father slipped, one night, into the mill pond and was drowned; and when his affairs came to be wound up, it was found that he had speculated disastrously in wheat; and that, after paying all claims, there was nothing left.  ""My mother took a little village shop, and I went to the village school. At first, I think I did not work very hard; but fortunately there was a change in masters, and the new one turned out one of the best friends a boy ever had. He pushed me on greatly and, when I was apprenticed to a mill wright, he urged me to continue my education by working of an evening. I stuck to it hard, and with his help learned, therefore, a good deal more than was usual, in my station of life. My mother was always particular about my speaking and, what with that and the books, I suppose I talk better than they generally do.""  ""And is your mother alive?""  ""Yes, sir.""  ""But how came you to think of emigrating, at your age; when indeed, you cannot have served out your full time?""  ""That, sir,"" Reuben said gravely, ""I cannot tell you. Some day, perhaps, if you care to know, I may bring myself to do so. I may say that it was a serious matter, but that I was really in no way to blame, whatever people may think. My conscience is absolutely clear, and yet I would rather that the story, which I left England to escape, should not be known to anyone.""  ""I do not seek to know further, Reuben. I think I know enough of you to be perfectly sure that you would do nothing that was wrong, and I am perfectly willing to take your word in the matter. However, I am glad that you have told me as much as you have. Your early rearing, your mother's care, and the education you have had, perfectly account for what seemed strange about you before. You have no objection, I hope, to my repeating your story to Mr. Hudson, who is as much interested in you as I am.  ""And now another thing. I know that it is painful, to him, that one to whom he is so indebted should be forward here in the forecastle, instead of being in the cabin. He was afraid of hurting your feelings, by speaking to you about it; but I know that it would be a great relief and pleasure, to him and Mrs. Hudson, if you would allow them to make an arrangement with the captain that, for the remainder of the voyage, you should be a passenger.""  ""I am much obliged to them,"" Reuben said quietly; ""but I could not think of accepting such an offer. I am working my way out independently, sir, and I owe no one anything. I am really enjoying the passage, and so far there has been no hardship worth speaking of. Even putting aside the fact that I should not like to accept an obligation which would, to most people, look like a payment for the service I was fortunate enough to be able to render to Mr. Hudson, I should feel out of my element. I am very comfortable, and get on very well with the men; while in the cabin I should feel strange, and out of place.""  ""I don't think you would seem out of place anywhere, Reuben. No one, from your manner and conversation, would judge you to be otherwise than a gentleman by birth; while there are several of the passengers, aft, whose talk and methods of expression are by no means up to the level of yours.""  ""I should feel uncomfortable myself,"" Reuben said, ""even if I didn't make other people uncomfortable. So I think that, with all gratitude for the offer, I would very much rather remain as I am. Accustomed as I have been to hard work, during my apprenticeship, the life here appears to be exceedingly easy.""  ""Then we will say no more about it,"" Captain Wilson said. ""It would have been a pleasure, both to me and the Hudsons, to have you aft, and I am sure you would be well received by all the passengers. However, as you think you would not be comfortable, we will let the matter drop.  ""However, as to your work in the colony, we must have a say in that; and I hope that, when I thoroughly understand your wishes, we shall be able to help you forward there.""  ""For that I shall be extremely obliged, sir. It would be a great thing, indeed, for anyone on landing to have gentlemen ready to assist him, and push him forward. This is so at home, and is of course still more the case in a strange country. I am very anxious to get on, and am ready to work my hardest, to deserve any kindness that may be shown me.""  ""Well, we shall have plenty of time to think it over before we arrive.  ""I fancy,"" Captain Wilson went on, looking upwards at the sky, ""that our wonderful run of good luck, with regard to the weather, is likely to end shortly, and that we are in for a gale.""  ""Do you think so, sir?""  ""I do, indeed; and if we do get a gale, it is likely to be a serious one. The Cape, you know, was much feared for its terrible storms by the Portuguese, and it has kept up its reputation ever since. I think it is going to give us a taste of its quality.""    Chapter 8: A Gale.   ""Wilson tells me he thinks we are going to have a gale, Bill.""  ""Ay, ay, Reuben; anyone with half an eye could see that.""  ""Which way is it likely to come?""  ""Most likely from the north or northwest. At least that's the quarter it's likely to settle into; but there ain't no saying which way it may take us. I thought things had been going on too smooth to last. Now you are going to see what a storm is, my lad. You thought it was blowing when we went down the Channel.""  ""Is it likely to be much heavier than that, Bill?""  ""Heavier!"" the sailor repeated scornfully. ""Why, there's as much difference between a capful of wind in the Channel, and a gale off the Cape, as there is between a newborn baby and me.""  ""Do they last long, generally?""  ""Last! Why they goes on for weeks. There ain't no end to them. I've wondered sometimes to myself where all the wind comes from, and where it goes to, onlass it works round and round.""  ""But it does work round and round, Bill?""  ""Ay, when you are near the centre of it. Why, lad, in three hours I have gone round the compass three times, with the wind dead aft all the time; but that's only when you are near the centre. When you ain't it blows straight, and I have known vessels run for days--ay, for weeks--with the wind blowing all the time in the same quarter. Some have been blown down right to the edge of the ice, south. I have been among the icebergs myself, two or three times, and I guess that many a ship has laid her bones down in the ice fields there, and no news ever come back home as to what's come to them; and what makes it worse is as we have convicts on board.""  ""What difference does that make, Bill?""  ""It don't make no difference, as long as all goes straight and fair. I have heard, in course, of risings; but that's only when either the guard are very careless, or the men is so bad treated that they gets desperate, and is ready to die on the off chance of getting free. So far we ain't had no trouble with them. The ship is kept liberal, and the poor wretches ain't cheated out of the rations as government allows them. The officer in charge seems a good sort, and there's no knocking of them about, needless; so there ain't no fear of trouble, as long as things go square. But when things goes wrong, and a vessel gets cast away or anything of that kind, then there's well-nigh sure to be trouble. The convicts seize their opportunity, and it ain't scarce in human nature for them not to take it, and then there ain't no saying what will happen.""  ""Why, what a croaker you are, Bill! I didn't expect that from you.""  ""I ain't no croaker, Reuben, but I knows what I knows. I have been through a job like that I am telling you of, once; and I don't want to do it again. I will tell you about it, some day. I ain't saying as I expect any such thing will happen, on board the Paramatta. God forbid. She's a tight ship, and she's got as good officers and crew as ever I sailed with. She has as good a chance as ever a ship had; but when I sees that 'ere sort of sky in these latitudes, I feels as we are in for a tough job.""  The conversation was broken off, abruptly, by the call of the first mate.  ""All hands aloft to shorten sail!""  ""The bells is ringing up for the beginning of the performance, Reuben. Here goes aloft!""  The next minute the whole of the crew were climbing the shrouds, for the watch off duty were all on deck, and the order was expected; for the signs of the weather could, by this time, be read by every sailor on board. Above, the sky was still bright and blue; but around the whole circle of the horizon, a mist seemed to hang like a curtain.  ""Smartly, lads, smartly,"" the captain shouted; ""don't hurry over your work, but do it with a will.  ""I hope we have not left it too long, Mr. James. I have held on longer than I ought, for every mile we get away from land is an advantage, and we have been running nearly due south, ever since I noticed the first falling of the glass when we got up in the morning.""  ""I think we shall have time, sir,"" the mate said. ""We are going to have it, and no mistake, presently; but it don't seem to be coming up fast.""  ""The glass is going down rapidly,"" the captain said. ""It's down an inch already, and is still falling.  ""Mr. Mason,"" he went on, to the officer in command of the detachment of marines, ""will you kindly place your men under the orders of Mr. James? I am going to send down all the upper spars, and they can be useful on deck.""  Never was the Paramatta stripped more rapidly of her sails, for every man was conscious of the urgency of the work. As soon as the sails were furled, the yards were sent down. The upper spars followed them and, in little over half an hour from the time the men began to ascend the shrouds, the Paramatta was metamorphosed. Her tall tapering masts and lofty spread of sail were gone. Every spar above the topmasts had been sent down to the deck; and she lay under close-reefed topsails, a stay sail, and a storm jib. The captain gave a sigh of relief, as the men began to descend the rigging.  ""Thank God, that is safely accomplished. Now we are in readiness for whatever may come.""  He dived into his cabin, and returned almost immediately.  ""The glass has fallen another half inch, Mr. James,"" he said gravely. ""I have never but once seen it as low.  ""Ladies and gentlemen,"" he went on, addressing the passengers, who were gathered in a group, talking in low tones and anxiously watching the wall of vapour; which now seemed to rise from the water's edge and reach far up into the sky, the circle of view extending scarce half a mile in any direction; ""I must ask you to go below, at once. The storm may strike us any moment now, and when it does come it will come heavily. I should like the deck perfectly clear, and nothing to disturb my thoughts from the working of the ship.""  Reuben had not gone aloft, as he was called back, just as he began to ascend the shrouds, by the first mate, and ordered to go round the cabins and fasten the dead lights securely. When this was done, he aided the marines in nailing tarpaulins over the cabin skylights, and then went round the deck, seeing that every movable article was securely lashed. When this was done he joined Bill who, with some others, had been at work securing all the hatches. The convicts had long since been all sent below.  ""Shall I send my men down, captain?"" Mr. Mason asked.  ""There is no occasion for it, just at present; but you had better pass the word for all of them to hold on, when the gale strikes her. That will be the critical moment. Once past that, she will be all right till the sea begins to rise. Then you had best get them below, for we shall have the water sweeping knee deep along the waist, in no time.  ""I should say send them down at once; but I know many of them have been to sea before, and may be useful in cutting away, if anything goes.""  ""She looks snug enough, captain,"" the young officer said, glancing up at the diminished spread of canvas.  ""She is snug enough for any ordinary gale,"" the captain said; ""but this is not going to be an ordinary gale. When we once get her before it, it will be all right.  ""Do you think we have another five minutes, Mr. James?""  ""There's no saying, sir; but I should think so. What do you want, sir?""  ""I want that top sail off her, altogether.""  ""I will do it, sir,"" the mate said and, calling Bill Hardy and two others of the best sailors, he led the way up the main shrouds.  Every eye on deck was fixed on the four seamen as, rapidly but steadily, they proceeded to furl and stow the sail. There was still not a breath of wind, but a low humming noise was heard.  ""Quick, Mr. James, never mind the sail. All hands on deck!"" the captain shouted; but the work was just done, and the sailors ran quickly down the ratlines on to the deck.  ""Thank God!"" the captain said reverently, ""that is done.""  The ship was now under the close-reefed fore-top sail, a diminutive try sail on the mizzen, and the jib. The hum had increased to a roar, but still not a breath of wind stirred the sails.  ""Look up!"" Bill said to Reuben; ""you may be at sea fifty years, and never see that again.""  Reuben looked up. Immediately overhead was a small circle of blue sky, round and round whose edge the edging of cloud seemed to be circling, with extreme velocity. The light seemed to pierce straight down onto the vessel, and she stood, pale and white, while all around her a pitchy blackness seemed to prevail.  ""We are in the eye of the storm, my lad. Here it comes. Now, hold on for your life.""  In another moment it seemed to Reuben that the end of all things was come. He was pinned against the bulwark, as if by a mighty invisible hand; and the vessel heeled over and over, until the deck seemed to rise in a wall above him. Then the water poured over him and, though he still held on, he thought the vessel had capsized. Then he felt her rising beneath his feet, and his head emerged from the water.  The captain, the first mate, and two seamen were at the wheel. Reuben saw the captain wave his hand, but his words were lost in the fury of the wind. The second mate, Bill Hardy, and two or three other sailors knew what was required, and hauled upon the lee brace of the fore-top-sail yard. The Paramatta was still lying nearly over on her beam ends, but gradually her head began to pay off, and she slowly righted. A minute later she was tearing directly before the gale. Scarcely had she done so, when the fore-top sail blew out of the bolt ropes, with a report that was heard even above the howl of the tempest.  ""It's done its work,"" Bill shouted in Reuben's ear. ""I thought she was gone. Just a little more, and she would have turned turtle.""  The captain had used almost precisely the same words to the first officer, adding:  ""She will do now, but we shall have to try to get a little more head sail on her, when the sea gets up. Call some of the hands aft, and get this try sail down. She yaws so, now the fore-top sail's gone, there is no steering her.""  This was soon done and, under bare poles, the storm jib now the only sail upon her, the Paramatta tore through the water. There was little motion, for the sea had not begun to get up, seeming to be pressed flat by the force of the wind. The captain now left the helm. Two or three of the male passengers were standing at the top of the companion, peering out.  ""You can come out, gentlemen, for a bit. She is running on an even keel now, though that won't last long. No one hurt below, I hope.""  ""Two or three of us have got bruised a little, captain; and I think we have all of us got a severe fright. We thought she was over.""  ""I thought so, too,"" the captain said. ""Luckily she has got three hundred tons of iron on board, and it's all stowed at the bottom of the cargo, so that helped her up again; but it was touch and go with her, for half a minute.  ""And now, gentlemen, if you will take my advice you will just look round, and then go below and turn in. Now you can do so easily. Another hour, and there will be no keeping a footing.""  The captain was right. In less than the time he named, a terrific sea had got up. The Paramatta had already made more than one circuit of the compass. There was no regularity in the sea. It seemed to rise suddenly in heaps, now striking the ship on one side, now on another, and pouring sheets of water over her bulwarks. The motion of the vessel was so tremendous that even Bill Hardy and the older seamen could only move along with the greatest difficulty to carry out the orders of the captain; while Reuben clung to the shrouds, now half buried in water, now almost hanging in the air, with the sea racing along under his feet.  As yet no more sail had been put upon her, for there was no following sea. Although running almost before the gale, a slight helm was kept upon her, so as to edge her out from the centre of the storm; and the second circle of the compass took more than twice as long as the first to complete, although the vessel was proceeding with equal speed through the water.  Hour after hour the sea got up--a wild, cross, broken sea--and the motion of the vessel was so terrific as to be almost bewildering to the oldest hands. There was none of the regular rise and fall of an ordinary sea; the vessel was thrown with violent jerks, now on one side, now on the other; now plunging her bow so deeply down that she seemed about to dive, head foremost, beneath the waves; now thrown bodily upwards, as if tossed up by some giant hand beneath her. The watch off duty was sent below, for there was nothing that could be done on deck; and the water swept over her in such masses as to threaten, at times, to carry everything before it. One man had had his leg broken. Several had been seriously bruised and hurt.  ""This is terrible, Bill,"" Reuben said, as he went below.  ""Ay, lad; I have been at sea, man and boy, over forty years, and it's the worst sea I ever saw. I expect to see her masts go out of her, before long. Nothing could stand such straining as this. You had best turn in at once. Unless I am mistaken, it will be all hands to the pumps, before long. If she hadn't been one of the tightest crafts afloat, she would have been making water at every seam, by this time.""  Reuben felt, the instant he lay down, that sleep was out of the question; for it needed all his strength to prevent himself from being thrown out of his bunk. The noise, too, was terrific--the rush and swell of the water overhead, the blows which made the ship shiver from stem to stern, the creaking of the masts, and howling of the wind. Night had set in, now. It was pitch dark in the forecastle, for the swinging lantern had been dashed so violently against the beams that the light was extinguished.  Half an hour after Reuben turned in, a crash was heard. A moment later the door was opened, and there was a shout:  ""The mizzen has gone! All hands to cut away the wreck!""  The watch turned out and began to make their way aft, and were soon engaged with knife and hatchet in cutting away the wreck of the mizzen which, towing behind, threatened, with each heavy following sea, to plunge into the vessel's stern. A cheer broke from the men as the last rope was cut, and the wreck floated astern. The mast had gone close to the deck, smashing the bulwark as it fell over the side. The motion of the ship was easier, for its loss.  ""Mr. James,"" the captain shouted, ""we must get preventer stays, at once, upon the fore mast. The main mast may go, if it likes, and at present we shall be all the better without it, but the foremast we must keep, if we can.""  ""Ay, ay, sir. I will set about it, at once.""  Picking out a few of the best hands, the first mate proceeded about the work.  ""Go and sound the well, Reuben,"" the captain said.  Reuben went off at once, and returned in two or three minutes.  ""There are four feet of water in it, sir.""  ""Four feet! Are you sure?"" the captain exclaimed.  ""Quite sure, sir.""  The captain handed over the command of the deck to the second officer, and went below with Reuben. First wiping the rod carefully, he sounded the well.  ""You are right,"" he said. ""It is three inches over the four feet. I fear that the bumping of the mizzen, before we got rid of it, must have started a butt. She could hardly have made so much water from straining.""  The captain made his way aft. The saloon was empty; the passengers, one by one, had retired to their cabins. He knocked at the doors of Mr. Mason and the chief warder.  ""The ship is making water fast,"" he said. ""We must rig the main-deck pumps. I can't spare any of the crew, their hands are full. Will you set the convicts to work?""  In a few minutes the clank of the pumps was heard. Very irregularly were they worked, for it was next to impossible for the men to stand to them, with the vessel throwing herself about so wildly.  The captain had remained on deck. He placed his hand on the shrouds of the main mast. One moment they hung loosely; and then, as the vessel rolled over, tightened themselves, with a sudden jerk, till they were as stiff as iron rods. He shook his head.  ""Reuben, make your way up to the chief officer, and tell him that I am going to get rid of the main-top mast. Tell him to see that everything is cut free from the fore mast.""  Reuben made his way aloft with difficulty. It needed all his strength to prevent the wind from tearing him from his grasp of the shrouds, but at length he reached the fore top, where the mate was at work. He delivered the captain's message.  ""Ask the captain to wait five minutes, till I get the back stay secured. I will send a man down, as soon as I am ready.""  ""You take this axe,"" the captain said, when Reuben regained the deck, ""and stand by this stay. When you see me ready to cut the other, cut at the same moment.""  In a few minutes Bill came down, with a message to the captain that all was ready. The latter raised his arm to Reuben. He waited till the vessel rolled over, and then lifted his axe. The two blows fell together on the stays. A moment later the vessel began to rise again. As the jerk came there was a crash above, and the main-top mast fell over the side, clear of the deck, having snapped off at the cap like a pipe stem.  ""Thank God for that,"" the captain said, as he cut away the connections on the other side, and the spar drifted astern, ""that is off our minds.""  The loss of the main-top mast and mizzen greatly relieved the strain on the ship, and she worked much easier. In half an hour, the first officer returned on deck with his party, and reported that he had done all he could to secure the fore mast.  ""The sea is becoming more regular,"" the captain said, ""now that we are getting further away from the centre of the storm. We shall soon have the waves racing behind us, like mountains, and we shall have to shake out the fore sail to keep ahead of them. Now, let us see how they are getting on below.""  The well was again sounded, and it was found that the water had gained two or three inches.  ""When the motion gets a little more regular, Reuben, you must take two or three hands, and work your way aft in the hold, and try and find out where the water is coming in.""  ""I will go at once, sir, if you like.""  ""No,"" the captain replied, ""it must not be thought of. Everything will be adrift, and you would be crushed to death, to a certainty. You must wait till we are out of this tumble. If the water gains no faster than it does now, two or three hours will make no material difference, and by that time I hope we shall have got a regular sea.""  Finding that there was nothing for him to do, Reuben again turned in. The motion was still tremendous, but he could feel a sensible change from what it was before. The motion of the ship was less sudden and violent and, although she rolled tremendously, she rose each time with an easier motion.  An hour later the watch turned out, and the others took their place. The wind was blowing as heavily as when the hurricane began, but the aspect of the sea had changed. It was no longer a mass of leaping, tumbling water; but was running in long waves, following each other, rising high above the vessel's stern as they overtook her. Having lashed himself to the side, he remained for an hour watching the sea. The first mate then came up to him.  ""The captain thinks you might manage to get aft now. I will send Bill and Dick Whistler with you, to help you move any boxes or bales.""  Reuben went back in the forecastle and got some tools, a piece of old sailcloth, and a large bundle of oakum; and then made his way with the two sailors down into the after hold. The way in which the upper tier of cargo lay heaped against the sides showed that it would, as the captain said, have been impossible to enter while the motion was at its worst. The rolling, however, had greatly diminished; the vessel rising and falling with a regular motion, as each wave passed under her. The men each carried a lantern and, with some difficulty, made their way to the stern.  ""Ay, it's somewhere about here,"" Bill said. ""I can hear the rushing of water, somewhere below. Now, the first thing is to move these bales.""  They worked for a time, and then Bill returned on deck to fetch two more hands. They brought hand spikes and bars, as the bales were wedged so tightly together that it was difficult, in the extreme, to move them. It took two hours' hard work before they reached the leak. As the captain had supposed, the head of one of the planks had been started, at the stern post, by a blow from the wreck of the mizzen; and the water was rushing in with great force.  ""A few hours of this would have settled her,"" Bill said. ""All the pumps in the ship would not keep down such a leak as this.""  Reuben at once set to work, cutting a deep groove in the stern post. He butted some stout pieces of wood into this, and wedged the other ends firmly against the first rib. Then he set to work to jam down sail cloth and oakum between this barrier and the plank that had started, driving it down with a marlinespike and mallet. It was a long job, but it was securely done; and at last Reuben had the satisfaction of seeing that a mere driblet of water was making its way down, behind the stuffing, into the ship.  ""That's a first-rate job, lad,"" Bill said approvingly. ""Half an hour's work once a week will keep her dry, if there is no water finds its way in anywhere else.""  Reuben went aft to the well. The pump was now working steadily, the gangs of convicts relieving each other by turns. On sounding the well, he found that the water had fallen nine inches since he had last ascertained its depth. Going on deck, he found that a misty light filled the air, and that morning was breaking.  The captain had two or three times come down to the hold, to watch the progress of the work. Reuben reported to him its completion, and the fall in the water.  ""Yes, it's been falling the last hour,"" the captain said. ""She will do now. But she's making water, still. Some of the seams must have opened. I have been looking her over, and can't find out where it is; and we can do nothing until the gale has blown itself out, and we can get below and shift the cargo.""  Reuben found that the fore sail had been set while he was below; and the vessel was running, some twelve knots an hour, before the wind. At one moment she was in a deep valley, then her stern mounted high on a following wave, and she seemed as if she must slide down, head foremost. Higher and higher the wave rose, sending her forward with accelerated motion; then it passed along her, and she was on a level keel on its top, and seemed to stand almost still as the wave passed from under her.  In spite of the extra lashing which had been given, the hen coops, spars, and everything loose upon the decks had been swept away; and the bulwarks had, in several places, been stove in. The galley had been carried away, but the cook had just made a shift to boil a cauldron of coffee below, and a mug of this was served out to all hands. As Reuben broke a biscuit into his portion, and sipped it, he thought he had never enjoyed a meal so much. He had now been, for eighteen hours, wet through to the skin; and the coffee sent a warm glow through him.  The captain ordered all hands, save a few absolutely required on deck, to turn in; and Reuben was soon in a glow of warmth beneath his blankets and, lulled by the now easy motion of the ship, was fast asleep in a few minutes.  After four hours' sleep, he was again on deck. The gale was blowing as strongly as ever, three men were at the helm, and the vessel was still tearing along at great speed. Several of the male passengers were on the poop, and the contrast between the appearance of the Paramatta at the same hour on the previous day, and that which she presented now, struck Reuben very strongly. Sadly, indeed, she looked with mizzen mast gone, the main mast shortened to the cap, and all the upper spars and rigging of the fore mast gone. She was, however, making good weather of it, for her hold was now so dry that the pumps were worked only on alternate hours, and the relief afforded by the loss of all her top hamper was very great.  For a week the Paramatta ran before the gale. At the end of the fourth day its force somewhat abated, but it still blew much too hard for anything to be done towards getting up fresh spars; while the lost mizzen rendered it impossible for them to bring her up into the wind.  ""It's bitterly cold, Bill,"" Reuben said. ""Its been getting colder every day, but this morning it is really bitter.""  ""And no wonder, lad, seeing that we have been racing south for pretty nigh a week. We have been making a little easting, but that is all, and we are getting into the region of ice. We may see some bergs any time now.""  ""I should like to see an iceberg,"" Reuben said.  ""The fewer we see of them the better,"" Bill replied, ""for they are about as nasty customers as you want to meet. I expected we should have seen them before, but this gale must have blown them south a bit. They work up with the northwesterly current, but I expect the wind will have carried them back against it. No, I don't want to see no icebergs.""  ""But if it were a very big one, we might get under its lee and repair damages a bit, Bill. Might we not?""  ""No, my lad. The lee of an iceberg ain't a place one would choose, if one could help it. There you are becalmed under it, and the berg drifting down upon you, going perhaps four knots an hour. No, the farther you keep away from icebergs the better. But if you have got to be near one, keep to windward of it. At least, that's my 'speryence.  ""They have been having some trouble with the convicts, I hears. They worked well enough at first, as long as they knew that there was a lot of water in the hold; but since then they have been a-grumbling, and last night I hear there was a rumpus, and six of them was put in irons. That's the first of it, and the sooner the gale's over, and we shapes our course in smooth water for Sydney heads, the better I shall be pleased.""  An hour later, Bill pointed to the sky ahead.  ""Do yer see nothing odd about that 'ere sky?""  ""No,"" Reuben replied, ""except that it's very light coloured.""  ""Ay, that's it, my lad. That's what they call the ice blink. You see if we ain't in the middle of bergs before night comes on. I have not been whaling for nothing.""  A few minutes later, the first mate was heard to be shouting orders.  ""Just as I thought,"" Bill said. ""We are going to try to rig a jury mizzen, so as to help us claw off the ice, if need be.""  A spare top mast was got up from below. Guys were fixed to one end and, with the help of the marines and a party of convicts, the spar was raised alongside the stump of the mizzen mast; and was there lashed securely, the guys being fastened as stays to the bulwarks. Blocks had been tied to the top, before it was raised; and ropes rove into them; and a try sail was brought on deck, and laid ready for hoisting.  The first mate ascended to the fore top, and at once hailed the deck that ice was visible ahead. The captain joined him, and for some minutes the two officers carefully examined the horizon. No sooner did the captain regain the deck than he ordered the try sail to be hoisted on the jury mast, and a haul to be given upon the braces of the fore sail, while the ship's course was laid a little north of east.  ""It is lucky the wind has gone down as much as it has,"" he remarked to Mr. Hudson. ""The sea is still heavy but, if that jury mizzen stands, we shall be able to claw off the ice.""  ""Is there much of it, captain?""  ""We could see a good many bergs and, from the look of the sky, I should say there was an ice field lying beyond them. However, I think we shall do, if the wind does not freshen again. If it does, we must do our best to make a group of islands lying down to the southeast, and there refit. They are a rendezvous for whalers, in summer.""  ""Why not do so now, captain?""  ""I would, if it were not for the convicts. But, unless as a last resource, I would not run the risk of touching at any island with them on board. As long as we are at sea they are comparatively harmless and, unless there is gross carelessness on the part of their guard, there is little fear of an outbreak. But once let them get on land, the matter is changed altogether. They are nearly three to one as against the warders, marines, and crew; and I would not run the risk, on any account, if it can be possibly avoided. No, no, Mr. Hudson, unless it be a matter of life and death, we will put in nowhere till we are in Sydney harbour.""    Chapter 9: Two Offers.   At nightfall the Paramatta was in the midst of the icebergs, and Reuben soon understood the antipathy which Bill had expressed for them. As a spectacle, they were no doubt grand; but as neighbours to a half-crippled ship, with half a gale blowing, their beauty was a very secondary consideration to those on board.  Additional stays were fixed to the jury mast, as it might be necessary, at any moment, to attempt to bring her up into the wind; and the word was passed that both watches must remain on deck. Fortunately the night was a light one, for the moon was up, and the sky almost cloudless. The mate stood with two of the best hands at the wheel; while the second mate took his place in the fore top, with a lantern, to signal the position of ice ahead. Fortunately there were but few small floating blocks about, and the Paramatta threaded her way through the larger bergs, without once approaching near enough to render danger imminent. It was a long and anxious night but, when morning broke, it was seen that the sea was now open ahead, and by the afternoon they had left the last berg behind.  Two days later the wind went completely down, and the crew at once set to work to repair damages. Reuben, with two men under him, filled up the breaches in the bulwarks. A respectable jury mast was rigged by the stump of the main mast; and the spar, which had done such good service among the bergs, was replaced by a longer and heavier one. All hands worked vigorously, and the sailors were assisted in the heavier work by parties of convicts.  After two days' toil all was completed. Sail was hoisted again and, under a greatly reduced spread of canvas to that which she had carried before the gale burst, the Paramatta proceeded on her way. The weather continued favourable and, without further adventure, the Paramatta arrived off Sydney heads; having made the voyage in a hundred and three days, which was, under the circumstances, a quick one.  The last evening Captain Wilson asked Reuben to go with him to the poop, as he and Mr. Hudson wanted to have a chat with him.  ""Now, Reuben,"" Mr. Hudson said, ""sit yourself down here. We must have a talk together. Now we want to know exactly what you are thinking of doing.""  ""I am thinking of getting work, sir,"" Reuben said, ""at my own trade.""  ""Well, my lad, I don't think you will make much at that. There are mills, of course, but not a great many of them; and I fancy you would find it difficult to get anything like regular work. The distances here are tremendous, and you would spend the money you made, in one job, in looking out for another.  ""That is the first view of the case. The second is, that neither Captain Wilson nor I mean to let you try it. You have saved my daughter's life, and I am not going to let the man who did that tramp about the country, looking for a day's work. Captain Wilson is going to marry my girl shortly, and of course he feels just the same about it. So the next question is, 'What is the best thing we can do for you?' Now, if you have a fancy for squatting, you can come with me up country and learn the business; and this day, twelve-month, I will hand you over the deeds of a range, with five thousand sheep upon it. Now, that's my offer.  ""Now, don't you be in a hurry to refuse it, and don't let me have any nonsense about your not liking to accept it. Ten such farms would not pay the debt I owe you, and I tell you I should think it downright mean, if you were to refuse to let me pay you a part of my debt. Now you shall hear Wilson's proposal.""  ""My offer is not so brilliant, Reuben. Indeed, as far as making money, the pay would probably be no higher, at first, than you might earn at your trade. I am, as you know, assistant superintendent to the constabulary force of the colony. Now, if you like, I will obtain you a commission as an inspector. The pay is not high, but by good conduct you may rise to a position such as I hold. It is the position of a gentleman, and the life is full of excitement and adventure. Now, what do you say?""  Reuben was silent for a minute or two.  ""I am greatly obliged to you both,"" he said, ""more obliged than I can tell you. Your offer, Mr. Hudson, is a most generous one; but I have not been accustomed to farming, and I would rather have such a life as that which Captain Wilson offers me, although the pay may be very much smaller.  ""But, sir,"" he said, turning to the officer of constabulary, ""I fear that I cannot accept your offer, because, in the first place, you see, I am not a gentleman.""  ""Oh, nonsense, Reuben! Your manners and language would pass you as a gentleman, anywhere. Besides which, there are several officers in the force who have risen from the ranks, and who have had nothing like the education you have had. You can put that aside at once. Is there any other reason?""  ""Yes, sir,"" Reuben said quietly. ""I had never intended to have spoken of it, and I came out to Australia in order that I might be away from everyone who knew the story, but I couldn't accept your offer without your knowing it. I am leaving England because I have been tried for burglary.""  ""Nonsense!"" both Reuben's listeners exclaimed, incredulously.  ""If you don't mind, I will tell you the whole story,"" Reuben said, ""and then you can judge for yourselves.""  Reuben then related at length the whole circumstances, with which the reader is already acquainted.  ""I remember reading your story in the papers, Reuben,"" Captain Wilson said. ""Being in the force, you know, I take an interest in these things. I own I was puzzled at the time--because, you see, I did not know you--but how anyone who did know you, could think you guilty, passes my comprehension.""  ""I call it infamous,"" Mr. Hudson added warmly. ""They must be a pack of fools, down at that place Lewes.""  ""Well,"" Captain Wilson said, ""I am glad you have told me your story; for I have all along been puzzled as to what made you give up your trade, and emigrate, at your age. However, the matter is explained now; but now you have told me, I see no reason whatever why you should not accept my offer. In the first place, no one but ourselves will know your history. In the next, if they did so, that is no reason why you should not hold the appointment. No man is free from the risk of being suspected unjustly. You have been acquitted by a jury of your countrymen and, even did everyone know it, no one dare throw it in your teeth.  ""No, I repeat, if you like I have no doubt that I can obtain for you an appointment as officer in the constabulary. You need not give me an answer now. Think it over for a week. You will have plenty of time, for Mr. Hudson insists upon your taking up your abode with him, when you land.""  ""That I do,"" Mr. Hudson said. ""I have a place a mile out of Sydney, and there you will stop for a bit. Then I hope you will go up the country with me, for a month or two, and learn the ways of the place; till Captain Wilson has got an appointment for you--that is, if you quite decide to accept his offer, instead of mine. But remember, if ever you get tired of thief hunting, the offer will still be open to you.""  Sydney was at that time but a very small place; for the great wave of emigrants had not yet begun to flow, and the colony was in its early infancy. As soon as the vessel cast anchor, Mr. Hudson and his party landed, taking Reuben with them; and an hour later he found himself installed, as a guest, at the squatter's house.  It was large and comfortable, surrounded by a broad verandah, and standing in a garden blooming with flowers, many of which were wholly unknown to Reuben. He had, of course, before landing laid aside the suit he had worn on board ship, and had dressed himself in his best; and the heartiness and cordiality of his host, his wife, and daughter soon made him feel perfectly at his ease.  ""We are in the rough, you know,"" Mr. Hudson said to him. ""Everyone is in the rough here, at present. Twenty years hence things may settle down, but now we all have to take them as we find them. The chief difficulty is servants. You see, almost every other man here is either a convict, an ex-convict, or a runaway sailor; about as bad material as you could want to see, for the formation of what they call at home a genteel establishment. The number of emigrants who come out is small. For the most part they have a little money and take up land, or at any rate, go up country and look for work there. A few, of course, who have been sent out by their friends at home to get rid of them, loaf about Sydney and spend their money, till they are driven to take the first job that offers. Well, they may do for shepherds, in places where no drink is to be had for love or money, but you would scarcely care about having them as butlers; so you see, we are driven to the three classes I spoke of. I have been exceptionally lucky. The man who carried the things upstairs just now, and who is my chief man here, is an ex-convict.""  Reuben looked surprised.  ""He was assigned to me when he first got his ticket of leave. I found him a good hand, and he stood by me pluckily, when my station was attacked by the blacks. So next time I came down to the town, I asked what he had been sent out here for. I found it was for having been concerned in a poaching fray, in which some of the game keepers got badly hurt. Well, that wasn't so much against him, you know, so I got talking to him one day, and found out that he came from my part of England. I found he had a wife, so I sent home money to some friends, and asked them to send her out; which they did and, finding she had, before she married him, been cook in a gentleman's family, I engaged her here, and sent up the country for Watson to come down. I had told him nothing about it; for I thought, perhaps, his wife might refuse to come out, or might have married again, or anything else.  ""Well, the meeting was a happy one, as you may suppose; and I then settled him down here--at least, it wasn't here, but a smaller place I had then--and he has been with me ever since. His time was out some years ago, but that has made no difference. Nothing would induce him to leave me; and I would not part with him for any amount, for a more faithful and trusty fellow never lived, and when I go away I know everything will go along like clockwork. As for his wife, she's a treasure, and she knows how to cook a dinner, as you will acknowledge presently.  ""They form the mainstay of my establishment. Besides that, there's an old chap who looks after the garden, goes down to the town, and does odd jobs. He was a sailor. He was landed here when his vessel came into port, five years ago. He had fallen off the yard on to the deck, and had broken half his ribs. He was taken to the government hospital. They did not think, at first, that he would ever get over it; but though he pulled through, it was clear he would never be fit for any hard work. So the surgeon of the hospital spoke of the case to me, and I said I thought I could find a job that would suit him, and here he has been. He is quite strong enough for all the work I want him to do, and I can trust him about the place. Of course, he breaks out and gets drunk occasionally, but one cannot expect to find a man perfect.  ""Then there is a black boy--they call them all boys here--he looks after the horses, and has two black boys--they are boys--under him. I found him out on the plains. He had been shot by some bush-ranging scoundrels, out of pure mischief, I should say. He was insensible when I found him, but I saw that he was alive, and managed to get him up on my horse and took him home. We were six weeks getting him round, for the bullet had gone through his body. It would have killed a white man in an hour, but these black fellows are as hard as nails.  ""My wife nursed him, for she was living up the country with me at that time; and when he got well, he declared that he would never leave us. I don't know that I was much gratified at the news, at first; but I soon found out that Sam, as I called him, was a valuable fellow about a place. He could turn his hand to everything, but I found he was specially happy when he was engaged about the horses; so at last I handed over that department to him, and when we set up this place here, I brought him down with me and made him head of the stables. It's fifteen years since I first picked him up, and I don't think I have ever had cause to find fault with him, since.  ""So you see, though my establishment can't be called a genteel, it's a thoroughly good-working one, and I doubt if there's a man in the colony who is as well off as I am.  ""When we go up country they all go with me except the sailor, who remains in charge. He's a great man, I can tell you, when he's left in what he calls command of the ship. He's got hold of two old muskets and a brace of pistols, and these he always loads before we start, so as to be ready to repel boarders. He looks out sharply, too, for I have never lost a thing since he came; and when you consider what a number of gentry there are, about here, with experience in housebreaking, I think that's pretty well. He is always drunk and incapable, for three or four days after our return, as a reward to himself for having kept from drink all the time we are away.""  ""Dinner is ready,"" Frances Hudson said, running into the room. ""Here you are, papa, talking away as usual, whenever you get the chance. Now run upstairs quickly, both of you; for Rachel will not be pleased if you let the first dinner get cold, after she has been doing her best to turn out something special, in honour of the occasion, ever since she heard the Paramatta was in port.""  ""I won't be a minute, Frances.  ""Ah, here comes Wilson. I was wondering what had become of him. He promised to come on, as soon as he had seen his chief.""  The dinner was an excellent one, and fully bore out Mr. Hudson's assertion with respect to his cook. All were in high spirits, with the exception of Mrs. Hudson, who was cool in her manners to the young officer, and was evidently desirous of showing her disapproval of his engagement to her daughter, which had only taken place two days before.  ""I have news for you, Reuben,"" Captain Wilson said, in the first pause of conversation. ""I saw the chief, and told him I wanted an appointment for a young friend of mine, who had come out in the Paramatta, and who had shown great pluck and presence of mind in an affair at the Cape, which I described to him. He said that he could appoint you at once, as young Houghton, a district superintendent, was killed three weeks ago, in an affair with the bush rangers up country. He said he was very glad to hear of someone likely to make a good officer, to fill his place. So if you make up your mind to be a constable, the place is ready for you.""  ""Thank you very much, sir,"" Reuben said, ""I was thinking the matter over last night, and quite made up my mind to accept the place you were kind enough to offer me, if you think me fit to fill it.""  ""I have no fear on that score, Reuben. I am sure you will do credit to my recommendation. So then, we may consider that as settled.""  ""There,"" grumbled Mr. Hudson, ""that's just like you, Wilson; you upset all my plans. It was arranged he was to come up to my station, and there, before you are on shore two hours, you arrange the whole business; and I suppose you will be wanting him to get into his uniform, and be off before a week's out.""  ""I daresay we can manage a fortnight,"" Captain Wilson laughed, ""and I have no doubt he will have plenty of opportunities for visiting you, later on. Indeed, I don't know why he should not be able to look you up, as soon as you get there. He will, of course, be placed under an old hand for six months, to learn his duties and get to speak a little of the native lingo.  ""Hartwell, who has your district, is as good a man as he can be put with. He is a careful officer, though perhaps a little slow; but he will be a good man for Reuben to serve under, and I know the chief will put him with him if I ask him, as it can't make any difference where he goes first.""  ""Well, if you can arrange that, Wilson, I will forgive you. And now, where are you going to?""  ""For the time, I am not going anywhere in particular,"" Captain Wilson replied. ""The chief says he thinks that things have got rather slack, since I have been away. There are several bands of bush rangers, who have been doing a deal of mischief up country; so to begin with, he wishes me to make a tour of inspection, and to report generally. After that, I think I shall be settled here for a time. At any rate, it will be my headquarters. I think it probable the chief himself will be going home on leave, before very long.""  ""The sooner you are settled here, the better,"" Mr. Hudson said; ""for I know I shall get no peace, now, till Frances is settled, too. Ever since she was a child, when she once made up her mind that she wanted a new toy, she worried me till I got it for her; and you are the last new toy.""  ""Oh, papa, how can you say so!"" Frances said, laughing and colouring. ""As far as I am concerned, it may be months and months.""  ""Oh, that is all very well,"" Mr. Hudson broke in. ""I know what you want. You want Wilson here to be always, neglecting his duty, and galloping over from the other end of the colony to see you. No, no, my dear, if Wilson is a wise fellow, he will bring you to book, as soon as I can either build, or get hold of, a place fit for you. We shall be having no peace, now. Every time he is off on duty, you will be picturing him as engaged in some dreadful struggle with bush rangers and blacks; and if letters don't come as often as you expect them, you will be fretting yourself into a fever.""  ""What nonsense, papa! I know, of course, George will have to do his duty. I don't suppose he's always going to be tied to my apron string.""  ""You take my advice, Reuben,"" Mr. Hudson said, ""don't you go and lose your heart; for if you once do, there's a police officer spoiled. It don't so much matter with Wilson, because he has done his share of dangerous work, and is pretty well up at the top of the tree; but a man that has to tackle bush rangers and blacks, ought not to have a woman at home thinking of him.""  ""There is no fear of that, for a good many years to come,"" Reuben laughed. ""Are these blacks really formidable fellows, Captain Wilson?""  ""Formidable to the settlers,"" Captain Wilson said, ""but not to us. They drive off cattle and sheep, and sometimes attack solitary stations, and murder every soul there; but they seldom stand up in fair fight, when we come down upon them; but they fight hard, sometimes, when they are acting with bush rangers.""  ""Bush rangers are mostly escaped convicts, are they not?""  ""Almost always,"" Captain Wilson replied, ""except that, of course, they have among them a few men such as runaway sailors, and ne'er-do-wells who get sick of shepherding and take to the bush; but the great proportion are convicts. It is not to be wondered at, when you look at the life many of these men have led at home, and the monotony and hardship of their lives in many of the up-country stations, allotted to men as ignorant, and sometimes almost as brutal as themselves.  ""Some of them, too, escape from the road gangs, and these are generally the worst; for as often as not, they may have killed a warder in making their escape, and know that it will go hard with them if they are caught.  ""It may be said that there are two sorts of bush rangers. The one are men who have taken to the bush, simply from a desire of regaining their liberty. Sometimes they join parties of blacks, and live with them. Sometimes two or three get together, and all the harm they do is to carry off an occasional sheep, for food. And the other kind are desperadoes--men who were a scourge in England, and are a scourge here, who attack lonely stations, and are not content with robbing, but murder those who fall into their hands.  ""They are in fact wild beasts, to whom no mercy is to be extended; and who, knowing it, will fight to the last. They are not easy to hunt down, their instinct having made them wary; and being generally in league with the blacks, who are as cunning as foxes, and can run pretty nearly as fast as a horse can gallop, they are kept very well informed as to our movements and, the country being so immense, we should never run them down, were it not for our native trackers.  ""These fellows are to the full as sharp as the Red Indians of North America. They seem, in fact, to have the instinct of dogs, and can follow a track when the keenest white's eye cannot detect the smallest trace of a footprint. It is something marvellous what some of them will do.""  ""Have you many of these trackers in your employment?""  ""There are one or two attached to every up-country station. They are, in fact, our bloodhounds; and although some of our men pick up a little of their craft, we should do nothing without them.""  The next morning, Reuben met Captain Wilson down in Sydney, and was taken by him to the chief of the constabulary, who at once made out his appointment. On his return, Mr. Hudson again started with him for the town, and insisted upon ordering his equipment. As Reuben saw that he would be hurt by any shadow of denial, he accepted Mr. Hudson's kind offer; although he had intended to ask Captain Wilson to make an advance of pay, in order that he might get what was necessary. He could not, however, have purchased such an outfit as Mr. Hudson insisted on getting for him; the latter ordering not only uniforms but suits of plain clothes, together with saddlery, holsters, a sword, and a brace of excellent double-barrelled pistols. He did not need to buy a horse, having in his stables one in every way suitable, being at once quiet and fast--it was, indeed, one of the most valuable animals in the colony.  ""You will have to keep your eyes open, Reuben,"" he said, as he gave him the horse, ""or he will be stolen from you. These bush ranger fellows are always well mounted, and anyone at an up-country station, who has an animal at all out of the ordinary way, has to keep his stable door locked and sleep with one eye open; and even then, the chances are strongly in favour of his losing his horse, before long. These fellows know that their lives often depend upon the speed of their horse and, naturally, spare no pains to get hold of a good one.  ""Ah, I have a good idea.  ""Jim,"" he shouted to one of the black boys, ""come here.""  The lad, who was about eighteen years of age, trotted up.  ""Jim, this gentleman is going to be a police officer, and he's going to take the bay with him; now he wants a good servant. Will you go with him?""  The lad looked longingly at the horse, which he had groomed and was very fond of; but he shook his head.  ""I no leave Massa Hudson.""  ""Yes, but I wish you to go, Jim. This gentleman is a great friend of mine, and when bad black man attacked young Missy, he saved her life. So I want him to be taken good care of; and the horse, too, and to see no one steals it. So someone I can trust must go with him. If you don't like him for a master, after you have tried him, Jim, you can come back to me again. You have been a good boy, and I have no wish to get rid of you; but this gentleman don't know the ways of the country, and I want to be sure he has someone with him he can trust.""  The lad looked at Reuben gravely, with his small eyes deeply sunken under the projecting eyebrows.  ""Jim will go,"" he said. ""He look after white man and Tartar, to please Massa Hudson and young Missy.""  ""That's right, Jim,"" his employer said.  ""That's a good stroke of business,"" he went on, as he turned away with Reuben; ""if you treat these black fellows well, and they get attached to you, they are faithful to death.""  ""You will see that fellow will never let your horse out of his sight. If you ride twenty miles across country, there he will be by your side as you dismount, ready to take it, and looking as fresh as paint. At night he will sleep in the stable, and will be ready, at all times and places, to make a fire, and cook a damper or a bit of meat, if you are lucky enough to have one by you. All the people about the place would do anything, I believe, for Frances; and the fact that you have saved her life will bind this boy to you, at first. Afterwards he will get to care for you, for yourself.""  A fortnight later Reuben, in his uniform as an officer of the constabulary, rode out of Sydney. His baggage had been sent on, three days before, by a waggon returning up country. Jim trotted, with an easy stride, behind him. Reuben at first was inclined to ride slowly, in order to give his attendant time to keep up with him; but he soon found that, whatever pace he went, the lad kept the same distance behind, without any apparent exertion; and he was, therefore, able to choose his own pace, without reference to Jim's comfort.  Four years passed. Reuben Whitney gave every satisfaction to his superiors, and was considered a zealous and effective young officer. So far he had not been placed in a position of great responsibility; for although for the last two years he had been in charge of a district, it was not far from Sydney, and his duties consisted principally in hunting for convicts who had made their escape, in looking after refractory ticket-of-leave men, and in ordinary constabulary work. He had learned in that time to become a first-rate rider, and a good shot with a pistol, accomplishments which would be of vital service when he was ordered to an up-country station. For his pistols he had as yet, however, had no actual use, as neither bush rangers nor natives penetrated so far into the settlement.  At the end of the four years' service, he received a letter from Captain Wilson, who had just succeeded to the chief command of the constabulary, ordering him to hand over charge of the district to the young officer who was the bearer of the letter, and to report himself at headquarters.  Reuben was now nearly three-and-twenty, and had grown into a very powerful young man. A life spent for the most part on horseback had hardened his muscles, and filled out his frame. He stood about five feet nine, but looked shorter, owing to his great width of shoulders. He was still quiet in manner, but he had the same bright and pleasant expression which had characterized him as a boy; and his visits to Sydney, where he was introduced by Captain Wilson and Mr. Hudson into the best society, had given him ease and self possession.  The native, Jim, was still with him. He had become greatly attached to his master, and his fidelity and devotion had been of the greatest service to him and, go where he would, the black was always at his heels.  On his presenting himself at Sydney, Captain Wilson said, after the first greetings:  ""I know you have been a little disappointed, Reuben, because hitherto you have been at stations where you have had but little opportunity of distinguishing yourself. However, I thought better to keep you at quiet work, until you were thoroughly master of your duties; and had, moreover, got your full strength. I don't know whether you have quite arrived at that yet, but I think you will do, anyhow,"" and he smiled as he looked at Reuben's shoulders.  ""I think I am as strong as most of them,"" Reuben said, smiling too. ""Four years' mill-wright's work, and four years on horseback in this bracing air, ought to make one strong, if there's anything in one to begin with. I think I shall do, in that respect.""  ""I think so, Reuben. I don't think there are many men in the force who could hold their own with you, in a grapple.  ""And now to business. You have heard of that affair of Inspector Thomas, in the Goora district--it was a bad business. He and two of his men were out, after some natives who had driven off cattle; and he was set upon by a party of bush rangers, and he and his men killed.""  ""So I heard, sir,"" Reuben said quietly.  ""Well, I have decided in sending you up in his place. It is a bad district--the worst we have, at present--and it needs a man of great resolution, and intelligence. I am sure that you have plenty of both, and that I cannot make a better choice than in sending you there. Your age is the only thing against you--not with me, you know, but others may think that I have done wrong, in selecting so young an officer--but you see, I know my man. I know, too, that several of the inspectors are getting too old for this sort of work. I do not mean too old, perhaps, in point of years, but they are married men with families, and for desperate work I prefer men without encumbrances.  ""The post should be held by an inspector, but I cannot promote you, at present. It would be putting you over the heads of too many. But you will have a good chance of earning early promotion, and I know that is what you like.""  ""Thank you very much, Captain Wilson. I will do my best to show myself worthy of your confidence.""  ""You will have all your work cut out for you, Reuben. The district has, all along, been a most troublesome one. The number of settlers, at present, is small. There is a good deal of higher bush than usual about it, which makes it very difficult to run these fellows down; and the natives are specially troublesome. Besides which, at present there are two or three of the worst gangs of bush rangers in the colony, somewhere in that country. You will have to be cautious as well as bold, Reuben. It is a dangerous service I am sending you on; still, the more danger, the more credit to you.""  ""You could not have given me a station I should have liked better; and I hope, ere long, I may be able to give you a good account of the bush rangers.""  ""And now, Reuben, if you will call again in an hour, I shall be free, and then I will drive you home. You need not start for a day or two; and you will, of course, stay with me till you do.""    Chapter 10: An Up-Country District.   Mrs. Wilson received Reuben, as usual, with the greatest cordiality; but she exclaimed loudly, when she heard that he was going to the Goora district.  ""You don't mean it, George. You can't mean that you are going to send Reuben to that dreadful place. Why, we are always hearing of murders and robberies there; and you know the last inspector was killed; and the one before recalled, because you said he had lost his nerve; and now you are sending Reuben there!""  ""But I look upon it as the greatest honour, Mrs. Wilson, being chosen for such a station; and you see, there will be capital chances of distinguishing myself, and getting promoted.""  ""And capital chances of being killed,"" Mrs. Wilson said, in a vexed tone. ""I do call it too bad, George.""  ""But, my dear, we want a man of pluck and energy. Besides, you know, we have been getting into hot water over that district. The press have been saying very severe things, about our incompetence to protect the outlying settlements, and I was obliged to choose a man who will give satisfaction; and you will agree with me that Reuben will do that.""  ""Of course he will,"" Mrs. Wilson agreed. ""I shouldn't be alive now, if he hadn't had plenty of pluck and energy; but for that very reason, you ought not to send him to such a dangerous post.""  ""But I wish to give him an opportunity for distinguishing himself. He wants to get on, and I want to push him on; but you see, I can't promote him over the heads of some eight or ten men, senior to him, unless he does something a little out of the way.""  ""Well, I don't like it, George, I tell you frankly. I always thought he was wrong, to go into the constabulary at all, instead of accepting papa's offer. I can't think why you men are so fond of fighting, when you could choose a quiet and comfortable life.""  ""But it is not always so quiet and comfortable, Frances, as a good many have found, in the district he is going to; and after all, it is less dangerous fighting bush rangers and natives when you are prepared for it, than to be woke up of a night with a band of them thundering at your door, and with no assistance within twenty miles.""  As Frances Wilson remembered how, in her childish days, her father's place had been, for three days, beset with blacks, she had no answer ready for the argument.  ""Well, I do hope, Reuben,"" she said, ""if you do go to this horrid place, you will take care of yourself, and not be rash.""  ""He's going to take care of others, Frances. You know, if he had taken care of himself and hadn't been rash, you would not have come so well out of that Malay business. I am sure he looks as if he could take care of himself, doesn't he?""  ""Yes, he is big enough and strong enough,"" Mrs. Wilson agreed, ""but that's no good against spears or boomerangs, to say nothing of rifles and pistols.""  ""Why, Frances, you are not generally a croaker,"" her husband said lightly, ""but for once, you seem to be determined to do your best to frighten Reuben, before he starts.""  Mrs. Wilson laughed.  ""No, I don't want to frighten him, George. I only want to make him careful.""  ""I will be as careful as I can, Mrs. Wilson. That boy Jim is a treasure. I will warrant, if there are any black fellows about, he will sniff them out somehow. That fellow has a nose like a hound. He has always been most useful to me, but he will be invaluable at Goora.""  Two days afterwards, Reuben left for his new command. It took him eight days to reach it. His headquarters were at Goora, a settlement of some twenty houses; besides the barracks in which the constabulary force, consisting of a sergeant, eighteen constables, and two native trackers, were quartered. The sergeant, a north-country Irishman named O'Connor, was somewhat surprised when Reuben rode up to the station; for the officers previously in command had been much older men.  Reuben's own quarters were in a cottage, close to the main building, and he asked the sergeant to come, in the evening.  ""Now, sergeant,"" he said, after a little preliminary talk, ""I have been sent up by Captain Wilson, with instructions to root out these bands of bush rangers.""  The sergeant smiled grimly.  ""We have been doing our best for the last three years, sir, but we have not made much of a hand at it.""  ""No,"" Reuben agreed, ""and I don't suppose, of course, that I am going to succeed all at once. In the first place, tell me frankly, what sort of men have we got?""  ""The men are good enough, sir, but they have certainly got disheartened, lately. One way and another, we have lost something like ten men in the last two years; and of course, that last affair with poor Mr. Thomas was a bad one.""  ""I understand,"" Reuben said quietly, ""some of them are not quite so eager to meet the bush rangers as they used to be.""  ""Well, that is perhaps about it, sir; but I must say the men have been tremendously hardly worked--pretty nigh night and day in the saddle, often called out by false news to one end of the district; and then to find, when they return, that those scoundrels have been down playing their games at some station at the other end. It's enough to dishearten a man.""  ""So it is, sergeant. I was speaking to Captain Wilson about it, and saying that if we are to succeed we ought to have some fresh hands, who will take up the work with new spirit. We are seven below our force, at present; and he has promised to send me up fifteen new hands, so there will be eight to be relieved. I will leave it to you to pick out the men to go. Mind, put it to them that they are to be relieved simply because Captain Wilson thinks they have had their share of hard work, and should therefore be sent to a quiet station, for a time. Just pick out the men whom you think would be most pleased to go.""  ""Very well, sir. I am glad to hear the news, for to tell you the truth, I do think we want a little fresh blood amongst us.""  Three days later the new detachment arrived, and Reuben saw, at once, that Captain Wilson had chosen a picked set of young men. About half of them were freshly enlisted in the force. The others had all been employed at up-country stations, and were well acquainted with the nature of the work before them. The same afternoon, the eight men picked out by Sergeant O'Connor as being the least useful on the station started for Sydney, most of them well pleased at being relieved from their arduous duties.  Reuben found that there were, in the office, a great many letters from settlers, asking for protection. It was impossible to comply with all these but, after consultation with O'Connor, he sent five parties, of three men each, to as many exposed stations; keeping ten in hand, to move as required.  Taking Jim, and two of the constables who had been longest on the station, he spent two months in traversing his district, from end to end, and making himself thoroughly acquainted with its geographical features; for he felt that, until he had mastered these, he should only be working in the dark. For a time the outrages had ceased, the bush rangers having shifted their quarters, and the natives withdrawn after the murder of the late inspector. This was a great relief to Reuben, as it permitted him to gain an insight into the country before setting to work in earnest.  Upon his tour, he and his followers were everywhere most hospitably received at the stations at which they halted. Everywhere he heard the same tale of sheep killed, cattle and horses driven off, and the insolent demeanour of the natives.  ""I was thinking of giving it up, and moving back into the more populated districts,"" one of the settlers said to Reuben; ""but now you have come, I will hold on for a bit longer, and see how it turns out. You look to me the right sort of fellow for the post; but the difficulty is, with such a large scattered district as yours, to be everywhere at once. What I have often thought of, is that it would be a good thing if the whole district were to turn out, and go right into the heart of the black country, and give them a lesson.""  ""From what I hear,"" Reuben said, ""it will be next to impossible for us to find them. The country is so vast, and covered with bush, that there would be no searching it. They have no fixed villages, and the want of water would render it impossible for us to go very far. But the worst point would be that they all seem to be well informed as to what is going on. I suppose they get warnings from the native herdsmen and servants, and if we were all together to enter their country, we must leave the stations unprotected, and we should find them in ashes, on our return.""  ""Yes, that is true,"" the settler said. ""I suppose it couldn't be done. But it's anxious work sleeping here, night after night, with one's rifle by one's bedside, never certain at what hour one may be woke by the yelling of the blacks. But they are not as bad as the bush rangers. If the blacks can but drive off your cattle, they are contented. You have got nothing else that is much use to them. The bush rangers don't want your cattle, beyond a head or two for present use; but they want everything else you've got, and whether you like it or not is quite immaterial to them. Thank God I have got no money in the place, and I and my three men can make a pretty good fight of it. But I pity the men with wives and daughters.""  ""Well, I hope we shall soon put a stop to it,"" Reuben said cheerfully. ""We will give them a lesson if we catch them, you may be quite sure.""  ""I hope so,"" the settler said. ""But you folks have been mighty unlucky, lately. Never seem to have been at the right place at the right time. Not that I am surprised at that, in such a district; but somehow they never come up with the fellows, afterwards.""  ""No, they seem to have had bad luck,"" Reuben agreed. ""I hope we shall do better now.""  Three days after his return from his last visit of inspection of his district, a settler rode, at full speed, up to the station.  ""Captain,"" he said--for although Reuben had no right to that title, he was always so called by the settlers--""the blacks have been down at my place. They have killed my two shepherds, and driven off the sheep.""  ""Sergeant O'Connor, turn out the men at once,"" Reuben shouted. ""See that their ammunition is all right, and let each man take a water skin and four days' provisions in his haversack.  ""When was it?"" he asked, turning to the settler again.  ""Some time yesterday afternoon--at least, I judge so. One of the men was to have come in for supplies, and when night came and he hadn't come in, I began to be afraid something was wrong, for I knew that they were getting short. So this morning, at daybreak, I rode out with the hands I have about the house. We could see nothing of the sheep, so we rode straight to the men's hut. There, lying some twenty yards away, was the body of one of the men, riddled with spear holes. He had evidently been running to the hut for shelter, when he was overtaken. I did not stop to look for the other, for no doubt he had been killed, too.""  ""Well, we will do what we can for you,"" Reuben said. ""I will be ready in five minutes.""  He ran into the house, buckled on his sword, put some cold meat and a small bag of flour into his haversack, together with some dampers Jim had just cooked, and then went out again. Jim had already brought his horse round to the door. Before mounting he took the pistols out of the holsters, and examined them carefully.  By this time the sergeant and ten men were in the saddle, and placing himself at their head, with the settler, whose name was Blount, he rode off at full speed; followed by his men, the two native trackers, and Jim. Reuben soon reined his horse in.  ""It will not do to push them too hard, at first. There is no saying how far we shall have to go.""  ""Do you mean to follow them into their own country?"" Mr. Blount asked.  ""I do,"" Reuben said. ""I will follow them till I catch them, if I have to go across Australia.""  ""That's the sort,"" Mr. Blount said. ""I expect you will find half-a-dozen other fellows at my station, by the time you get there. I sent my hand off on horseback to the stations near, to tell them what had taken place, and that I had ridden off to you, and asking them to come round.""  ""How far is it?"" Reuben asked.  ""About forty miles.""  ""But your horse will never be able to do it,"" Reuben said.  ""I got a fresh horse at a friend's, four miles from your station, so I am all right.""  ""They will have more than a day's start of us,"" Reuben remarked presently.  ""Yes; thirty-six hours, for you will have to stop at my place tonight. But they can't travel very fast with sheep, you know.""  ""No,"" Reuben agreed. ""If they had had cattle, it would have been useless following them; but with sheep we may come up to them, especially if they don't think they will be followed far.""  ""No; that's my hope. They will know I had forty miles to ride to your station. Besides, had it not been that I was expecting the shepherd in for supplies, I might not have found it out for two or three days. So I expect they will think that they are pretty safe from pursuit. They have never been followed far into the bush. It's nasty work, you see.""  ""It's got to be done,"" Reuben said. ""It is impossible to keep guard everywhere, and the only way to put a stop to these outrages is to teach the blacks that punishment will follow, wherever they go.""  It was late in the afternoon before they arrived at Mr. Blount's station. They found fourteen or fifteen of the neighbouring settlers gathered there. They came out as the sound of the trampling of the horses was heard. Several of them were known to Reuben, from his having stopped at their stations.  ""Glad to see you, captain, but I am afraid you are too late,"" said Dick Caister, a young settler whose station lay about twelve miles away.  ""That remains to be proved,"" Reuben replied, as he dismounted.  ""Oh, they have got twenty-four hours' start, and it's too late to do anything tonight. They must be thirty miles away in the bush, already.""  ""If they were a hundred, I would follow them,"" Reuben said.  There was an exclamation of surprise, and something like a cheer, on the part of some of the younger men.  ""The difficulties are very great,"" one of the elder settlers said. ""There is neither food nor water to be found in the bush.""  ""I know it's not an easy business,"" Reuben said quietly. ""But as to food, we can carry it with us; as to water, there must be water in places, for the natives can no more go without drinking than we can. There must be streams and water holes, here and there. But however difficult it is, I mean to attempt it. It is the only way of bringing the blacks to book; there can never be safety among the outlying settlements, unless the fellows are taught a lesson.  ""And now, gentlemen, before we go further, I want to say this: I know that you are all ready to help, that you are all thirsting to wipe out old scores with the blacks; but at the same time I would point out to you that it is likely enough that the bush rangers, who certainly work with the blacks, will follow up this stroke. Therefore, it will not do to leave the stations defenceless. I do not want a large force with me. If we once overtake the blacks, I have no fear whatever of being able to give a good account of them. Therefore I would urge, upon all of you who are married men, that it is of the first importance that you should stay at home, in case the bush rangers take the opportunity of our being away to pay you a visit. That is the first thing to be thought of. If any of the others like to go with us, I shall be very glad of their assistance. We may be away for a week or more, for ought I know.""  ""That is certainly the best plan, captain,"" Dick Caister said. ""As you say, let the married men stop at home and guard their stations. I think the rest of us will all go with you.""  There was a chorus of approval. Eight of those present were married men and, though reluctant to give up the thought of punishing the blacks, they were yet glad that they were not called upon to leave their wives and families. With many good wishes for the success of the expedition, they at once mounted, and rode off to their respective stations, some of which were more than twenty miles away.  ""Now for ways and means,"" Reuben said. ""What spare horses have you, Mr. Blount?""  ""I have only two, besides the one I am riding.""  ""I should like to take at least six. We must carry a good store of provisions.""  ""I don't think you need trouble about that,"" Mr. Blount said. ""We must take a supply of flour with us, and of course tea and sugar; and a few bottles of rum will not be amiss. All these I can furnish. But as to meat, I do not think we need trouble. Going as fast as the blacks will travel, there are sure to be lots of the sheep fall by the way. The blacks will eat as many as they can, but even a black cannot stuff himself beyond a certain extent, and there will be plenty for us.""  ""Yes, I did not think of that,"" Reuben replied; ""in that case two spare horses will be enough.""  ""It would be a good thing to have a few with us, though,"" one of the young men said. ""My place is only six miles off. I will ride over and bring back three with me; they are all good ones, and I should be sorry to find they were gone when I get back. I can lead one, my black boy can ride another and lead the third. It is likely enough some of the horses may give out, or get speared if the blacks make a fight of it, and half a dozen spare horses would come in very handy.""  Reuben thought the plan was a good one, whereupon two of the others also volunteered to ride over and fetch--the one three and the other two--horses.  ""That will make ten altogether, with Blount's two. We shall travel all the faster, because we can ride the spare horses by turns.""  The three settlers rode off at once, and returned late at night with the spare horses. They had not been idle at Mr. Blount's. A bullock had been killed and cut up, and a considerable portion cooked, so that each of the twenty men going on the expedition would start with ten pounds of cooked meat, in order to save the time that would be spent in halting to cook the carcass of any sheep they might come upon. The question of weight was immaterial, as the meat could be packed on the spare horses.  As soon as day broke, the party were in their saddles. Mr. Blount led them first to the hut near which he had found his shepherd killed. The native trackers now took up the search. The body of the other shepherd was found half a mile away. It was in a sitting position by a tree; the skull was completely smashed in by the blow of a waddy, and it was evident that a native had crept up behind him, and killed him before he was conscious that any danger was at hand. The trackers were not long in finding the place where the sheep had been collected together and driven off, and a broad track of trampled grass showed, clearly enough, the direction which had been taken.  ""How many of the black fellows do you think there were?"" Reuben asked one of the trackers.  ""Great many black fellow, captain,"" he replied.  ""What do you call a great many?"" Reuben asked.  ""Twenty, thirty, captain; can't say how many. No use, captain, look for dem, gone right away into de bush, never find them.""  ""I am going to try, anyhow,"" Reuben said. ""Now, do you lead the way.""  ""I tink dere are more dan thirty black fellow,"" Jim said to Reuben, as they started; ""quite a crowd of dem. Me no much like those two black fellow,"" and he nodded towards the trackers, who were running on ahead. ""No good, those fellows.""  ""What makes you think that, Jim?""  ""Two days ago, Jim saw dem talking wid black fellow, half a mile from the station. Not know Jim saw dem. Secret sort of talk. Why dey never find de tracks before black fellows and bush rangers always get away? Jim tink those fellows no good.""  Reuben himself had often thought it singular that such continued bad luck should have attended the efforts of his predecessor to hunt down the bush rangers, but the thought that they had been put off their scent by the trackers had not occurred to him. He had the greatest faith in Jim's sagacity and, now that the idea was presented to him, it seemed plausible enough.  ""Very good, Jim, you keep your eye on those fellows. I will do the same. We shall soon find out if they are up to any tricks.""  Jim had been running by his master's stirrup, while this conversation had been going on; and he now dropped into his usual place at the rear of the party. For some miles the trail was followed at a hand gallop, for the grass was several inches in height, and the trail could be followed as easily as a road. The country then began to change. The ground was poorer and more arid, and clumps of low brush grew here and there. Still, there was no check in the speed. The marks made by the frightened flock were plain enough, even to the horsemen; and bits of wool, left behind on the bushes, afforded an unmistakable testimony to their passage.  ""They were not going so fast, here,"" Mr. Blount said, after dismounting and examining. ""The footprints do not go in pairs, as they did at first. The flock has broken into a trot. Ah! There is the first, ahead.""  In a hundred yards they came upon the skin and head of a sheep. Nothing else remained. Unable to keep up with the flock, it had been speared, cut up, and eaten raw by the blacks. In the next mile they came upon the remains of two more; then the track widened out, and the footprints were scattered and confused. The horses were reined up, and Jim and the trackers examined the ground. Jim returned in a minute or two.  ""Black fellows give em a rest here. Could no go any furder. Lie down and pant.""  One of the trackers then came up.  ""They stop here, captain, five six hours till moon rise. Make fire, kill sheep, and have feast.""  Reuben and some of the settlers rode over to the spot to which the tracker pointed.  ""Confound them!"" Blount exclaimed. ""Look there! There are at least twenty heads.""  ""So there are,"" Reuben said. ""There must have been a lot of natives.""  ""Yes, there must have been a good many,"" the settler agreed, ""but not so many, perhaps, as you would think. Nobody has ever found out, yet, how much these blacks can eat when they make up their mind to it; but two could certainly devour a sheep. They will eat till they can't sit upright.""  ""They would hardly eat as much as that, with a long journey before them,"" Reuben said; ""but allow only three to a sheep, there must be sixty of them. My man said there were a good many more than the trackers put it down at.""  ""So much the better. I only hope they will show fight.""  After five minutes halt, the ride was continued for the next three hours. Then three dead sheep were passed. This time the flesh had not been devoured, but the poor beasts had, in every case, been speared.  ""Savage brutes!"" Reuben exclaimed. ""They might at least have given the sheep a chance of life, when they could go no further, instead of wantonly slaughtering them.""  ""That's their way, always,"" Mr. Blount said. ""They kill from pure mischief and love of slaughter, even when they don't want the meat. But I don't suppose it makes much difference. I expect the sheep have dropped as much from thirst as from fatigue, and they would probably have never been got up again, after they once fell. I fancy we shall come upon a stream, before long. I have never been out as far as this before, but I know that there is a branch of the Nammo crosses the bush here, somewhere.""  Another five miles, and they came upon the river. The wet season was only just over, and the river was full from bank to bank. It was some thirty yards wide, and from two to three feet deep. A score of sheep lay dead in the water. They had apparently rushed headlong in, to quench their thirst; and had either drunk till they fell, or had been trampled under water, by their companions pressing upon them from behind.  For the next ten miles the track was plain enough, then they came to a series of downs, covered with a short grass. At the foot of these another long halt had been made by the blacks.  ""We must have come twenty-five miles,"" Reuben said.  ""Quite that, captain. The flock must have been dead beat, by the time they got here. I should think they must have stopped here, last night. We will soon see--there is one of their fireplaces.""  The settler dismounted, and put his hand into the ashes.  ""Yes,"" he said, ""they are warm still. They must have camped here last night. They started when the moon rose, no doubt. Thus they have eight or nine hours' start of us, only; and as they can't travel fast, after such a journey as they had yesterday, we ought to be able to catch them long before night.""  ""They will go better today than they did yesterday,"" Mr. Blount said. ""They were over-driven to start with, and that was what knocked them up; but the blacks will begin to feel themselves safe today, and will let them go their own pace. Sheep can do twenty miles in a day, if not hurried.""  ""Well, at any rate,"" Reuben said, ""we will give our horses a couple of hours' rest. It is just eleven o'clock now, and I should think everyone is ready for a meal.""  There was a chorus of assent. The troop dismounted at once. The girths were loosened, the bits taken from the horses' mouths, and they were turned loose to graze in the long grass at the foot of the hill. There was no fear of their attempting to stray, after their journey of the morning. Some of the men set to to cut brush, and in a few minutes a fire was lighted. One of the sheep, of which there were several lying about, was skinned and cut up; and slices, on skewers of green wood, were soon frizzling over the fire.  Twenty minutes later, the water in a large pot hanging over the fire was boiling. Three or four handfuls of tea were thrown in; and with the fried mutton, cold damper, and tea a hearty meal was made. Then pipes were produced and lighted; while several of the men, lying down and shading their faces with their broad hats, indulged in a doze.  ""One o'clock,"" Reuben said at last, looking at his watch. ""It is time to be moving again.""  The horses were fetched in, the bridles replaced, and the girths tightened.  ""Now, which way?"" Reuben asked the trackers.  ""Along here, captain, by de foot of de hill, de trail is plain enough.""  It was so. A track of some width was trampled in the grass.  Reuben was about to give the order to proceed, when he caught Jim's eye, and saw that the black wished to speak to him privately.  ""What is it, Jim?"" he asked, going apart from the rest.  ""That not de way, captain. A hundred, two hundred sheep gone that way, wid four or five black fellow. De rest have all gone over de hill.""  ""Are you sure, Jim?""  ""Me quite sure, sar. De ground very hard; but while de captain smoke him pipe, Jim went over de hill, saw plenty sign of sheep. Went straight uphill, and then turned away to de left. Dis little party here hab only gone to frow white man off de trail.""  ""The trackers ought to have seen that as well as you, Jim,"" Reuben said angrily.  ""Dey see, sar, sure enough. Could no help seeing, wid half an eye. You see, sar, dose fellows up to no good. Lead party wrong if dey can. Don't say, sar, Jim told you. If you say dat, put 'em on their guard. Massa ride along the trail for a bit, just as if talk wid Jim about odder affair; den after little way, begin to talk about trail being too small, den turn and come back here, and go over de hill.""  ""A very good idea, Jim. I will do as you say.""    Chapter 11: The Black Fellows.   A few minutes after his conversation with Jim the party started, following the broad track through the grass along the foot of the hill. Reuben informed Mr. Blount of what Jim had told him.  ""By Jove, I think he is right,"" the settler said. ""The track is as broad as it was, but it is nothing like so much trampled down; but if your fellow says the main body have gone over the hill, why are you following this track?""  Reuben gave his reasons, and said that his man had, before, had suspicions that the trackers were in communication with the wild blacks.  ""He thinks that's why it is that they have so frequently failed, here, to catch any of these fellows.""  ""I shouldn't be at all surprised,"" Mr. Blount said savagely. ""The best thing would be to put a bullet into each of the rascals' heads.""  ""I think Jim's idea is best,"" Reuben said. ""Now that we have once got our eyes open, they won't be able to do us any more harm; and my black fellow will see we follow the trail right. I don't want them to see we have any suspicions of them, as that would put them on their guard; and by keeping our eye upon them, we may be able to turn the tables.""  ""That is so,"" Mr. Blount agreed. ""What are you going to do, then?""  ""I will call to them, in a minute or two, and tell them that it is your opinion that only a small portion of the flock have come this way. Then we will have a consultation and, no doubt, some of your friends will notice that the ground is not much trampled. Then we will decide to ride back to the point from which we started, and will follow the other trail.""  ""Yes, that will do very well,"" the settler agreed.  Reuben at once called to the trackers, who were trotting on ahead, and then ordered a halt. The two blacks came back.  ""Joe,"" Reuben said, ""Mr. Blount thinks that the main body of the flock have not come this way. He says he thinks only a hundred or two have come. The ground does not look to me anything like so much trampled as it was before we halted.""  ""I tink most of dem hab come along here,"" the tracker said sullenly.  ""What do you think?"" Reuben asked the other settlers, who had gathered round.  ""I did not notice it before,"" Dick Caister said; ""but now Blount has pointed it out, I agree with him entirely. There are nothing like the full number of sheep have passed along here. I should say that they have not gone along more than two or three deep.""  There was a general chorus of assent.  ""You can't have been keeping your eyes open,"" Reuben said to the trackers, sharply. ""If you don't look sharp in future, we shall quarrel.  ""Come, gentlemen, let us ride back to the halting place, and see if we cannot find out which way the main body have gone.""  Ten minutes' riding took them back to their starting place.  ""They must have gone over the hill,"" Reuben said. ""They certainly have not kept along at the foot, or we should see their tracks in this long grass.""  The trackers had exchanged a few words in a low tone, and they now moved up the hill, and began to examine the ground carefully.  ""Some of dem have gone this way, captain.""  ""Of course they have,"" Mr. Blount said. ""A blind man might see that.""  The marks of the sheep were indeed plain enough to all, when their attention had once been drawn to the subject. On getting beyond the crest the trackers turned to the left, and Reuben saw that they felt it would be hopeless to attempt, further, to mislead a party containing several settlers who were perfectly capable of following the trail.  Jim had, since speaking to his master, remained in the rear of the troop. After three miles' riding across the downs, they again came down upon a flat country, thickly covered with brush. Here and there pieces of wool sticking to thorns were visible, and the trackers went steadily on for some little time. Then their pace became slower, and finally they stopped.  ""Trail ended, captain.""  ""What do you mean by the trail ended?"" Reuben asked angrily. ""Why, I can see a piece of wool, on there ahead.""  ""Dat so, captain; but only a few sheep hab passed here.""  Some of the settlers dismounted and, having examined the ground carefully, declared that they were of the same opinion as the trackers.  ""Very well,"" Reuben said; ""then in that case, we must go back again to the foot of the hill. They were all together there, and we must take up the trail afresh.""  On reaching the foot of the hill, Jim and some of the settlers joined the trackers, and penetrated the bush in all directions. Each returned bringing in pieces of wool.  ""It is plain enough,"" Reuben said, ""what they have done. They have broken up into small parties, and have scattered. The question is, 'What are we to do now?'  ""What do you think, Mr. Blount? You have had more experience than anyone here, and you are the most interested in our overtaking these rascals. What do you recommend?""  ""I don't know what to recommend,"" the settler said. ""They have no doubt done it to confuse us, in case we should follow so far, and avoid being thrown off the scent the other side of the hill. The band may really have scattered, and gone off in small parties to different parts of the bush; or again, they may have scattered with the understanding that they will meet again, at some given spot, which may be ten and may be fifty miles ahead.""  ""The worst of it is,"" Reuben said, ""I fear now that there is an end of all chance of coming up with them, today; and now the question of water comes in. If we could have caught them before nightfall, the horses, having had a good drink at that stream, could have done very well till we'd gone another thirty miles; but as that seems hopeless, now, we must consider seriously what we had best do, before we go any further. Does anyone here know anything of the country ahead?""  There was a general silence.  ""The horses can do very well, tomorrow, without water,"" Mr. Blount said. ""They will chew the leaves of this scrub; and can, if pressed, hold on for even two or three days upon it.""  ""In that case,"" Reuben said, ""let us go on. We will break up into three parties. One shall go straight forward, the other two moving to the right and left, each following the tracks as well as they can. We will not go much beyond a walk. We have five more hours of daylight yet, and the horses can manage another fifteen miles. I will halt, an hour before it gets dark, and light a fire. The smoke will be a guide to the other two parties, who should not be more than a couple of miles to the right and left, and they will then close in.  ""If you can suggest any better plan than that, Mr. Blount, please do so. Of course, I see the objection that the blacks may make out the smoke, and will know that they are being followed.""  ""Yes, that is an objection,"" Mr. Blount said; ""but the chances are that they will know it without your telling them. It is more than probable that some of them have remained behind, on the watch; and that they will have signalled our coming, long ago.""  ""Dey have done that, sar,"" Jim, who was standing close to Reuben's elbow, put in. ""Jim saw smoke curl up from the top of de hill, just when we turned, when we lost the trail.""  ""Why didn't you tell me before, Jim?"" Reuben asked.  ""De captain didn't ask Jim any question. Jim thought de captain see it for sure.""  ""I didn't see it, Jim. I don't think any of us saw it. We were all too much occupied looking for the trail. Another time, you tell me what you see without my asking.  ""Well in that case, Mr. Blount, there can be no harm in my making a smoke, as they know already that they are pursued. Will you take charge of the right hand party? Sergeant O'Connor will take command of the left. Do you each take a tracker with you. I will take my boy. Three constables will go with each of your parties, and four with me.  ""Will you gentlemen please to divide up, so as to make seven altogether in each party, without the natives?""  ""I need not tell you to keep a sharp lookout, Captain Whitney. We know the blacks are a very strong party and, now they know that they are pursued they may, as likely as not, make a stand.""  ""Yes, that is quite possible,"" Reuben agreed. ""Will you please be careful that neither of your parties get more than two miles, at the outside, away from mine? We can hear the sound of rifles, at that distance. If either party fires, the others will of course hurry to their assistance. Now, let us move forward.""  With Jim in advance, Reuben's party moved on, the black carefully examining the ground and bushes as he went; and occasionally, somewhat to Reuben's surprise, rising from the stooping position in which he was walking, and looking back over his shoulder. The motive was explained when Jim exclaimed:  ""Dere, captain, dere are de signals again.""  Reuben turned in the saddle. On the crest of the hill behind him were three columns of smoke. Scarcely had he looked at them when the smoke ceased to ascend, as if the fires had been suddenly put out.  ""That's to tell them that we have divided in three parties?"" Reuben asked the black.  Jim nodded, and proceeded on his way again.  ""That's awkward,"" Reuben said, ""I must warn the other two parties.""  So saying, he at once ordered two of the constables to ride right and left and warn the others, who were not as yet more than a quarter of a mile on either hand, that the natives were aware that they had broken up, and that the greatest caution must, therefore, be observed. In ten minutes the two constables returned, having performed their mission.  Although he had no reason to believe that the blacks were within ten miles of him, Reuben now took the precaution of sending one constable out on each flank, to a distance of fifty yards. A third was directed to keep with Jim, fifty yards ahead of the main body; consisting of Reuben himself, a constable, and two colonists. Occasionally Reuben rode forward to question Jim.  ""How many sheep do you think have gone along the track you are following?""  ""About thirty sheep, and three black fellow.""  ""How do you know there are three black fellows, Jim? I can see marks, sometimes, of the sheep's feet; but I have not seen a man's footprint at all.""  ""Jim see 'em, captain, plain enough. When dey all follow sheep, not very plain to see; but sometimes, when de sheep want to scatter, Jim see one footmark on one hand and one on the other, and sure to be one man behind.""  ""How far are the sheep ahead, Jim, have you any idea?""  ""Six, eight hours, sar, when dey pass here; but dere's no saying how far they are, now. May be long way on, may be only little way. Me tink dat they hab not gone so berry far; dat smoke berry thin, not see him more than ten miles.""  ""I wish you had said that before, Jim,"" Reuben said. ""We would have kept together and have galloped on, and taken our chance of finding them.""  ""Might have found four or five of dem,"" Jim replied, ""but de others all scattered. No good to find dem, till dey come together again.""  ""No, you are right there, Jim. We must catch them all together, if we can. There are some twelve hundred sheep, somewhere ahead. Mr. Blount said there were about fifteen hundred driven off. We have come upon a hundred dead ones, and two or three hundred may have taken that turn to the right. As you say, it would be no good coming upon thirty.""  For four hours the party continued their journey.  ""It is six o'clock,"" Reuben said, looking at his watch. ""We will halt, now, and light that fire.""  Two of the constables were told off to keep watch, some fifty yards in front; and the others dismounted, and gathered together materials for a fire. This was soon done, and the smoke mounted straight and clear, a signal to the other two parties to close in.  Suddenly a cry was heard from one of the sentries. The men stooping round the fire leaped to their feet, just in time to see one of the constables struck from his horse by a boomerang, while a dozen spears whizzed through the air at the other. He fell forward on his horse, which carried him up to the fire; as he fell from the saddle, as it stopped, he was caught by two of the others. Three spears had pierced him.  ""Stand to your arms. Steady, for your lives,"" Reuben shouted.  ""Jim, throw the horses at once, and fasten their legs.  ""We must defend ourselves here,"" he continued, turning to the others, ""until help comes.""  Not a moment was lost. The little party threw themselves down in a circle, each taking shelter behind a bush; and Jim speedily got the eight horses down in the centre, for each party had with it three of the spare animals. The whole time, from the first alarm until all was ready to receive the natives, did not occupy two minutes.  The horses of the sentries had galloped wildly on, both having been struck by spears; and Jim had no difficulty with the remainder, which were all standing in a group when the alarm was given, the owners not yet having removed their saddles.  All was done without flurry or excitement, although the yells of the natives rose from the bush all round them. The bush was fortunately not very thick at the point where they had halted, Reuben having selected it for that very reason; but the bushes were sufficiently near to each other to enable an enemy to creep up, within thirty yards or so, without being seen.  ""Don't throw away a shot,"" Reuben called out; ""but pick off the blacks, as they stand up to throw their spears.  ""Ah!""  The exclamation was accompanied by a shot from his rifle, as a native rose suddenly from the bush and hurled his spear. It missed Reuben by an inch or two only; but, as his rifle flashed out, the black threw up his hands and fell back in the bush.  ""Here, sah, dis make good shelter;"" and Jim propped up his saddle, almost in front of him.  ""That's a good idea, Jim; help the others in the same way.""  [Illustration: A Fight with the Black Fellows.]  The five men were all engaged now. The spears whizzed fast over and among them, but most of them were thrown almost at random; for the blacks soon learned that to raise themselves above the bushes, to take aim, was to court sudden death. Jim, after distributing the saddles to their owners, had lain down by the side of his master; and loaded his rifle as fast as he discharged it, Reuben using his pistols as effectually as the rifle, in the intervals.  Fortunately all the party were provided with these weapons. Had it not been so, each man would have been liable to be rushed by the blacks every time he discharged his rifle. As far as possible they fired by turns; so that each man, while loading, was covered by the fire of those on his right and left.  For half an hour the fight continued. Many of the blacks had fallen, but they continued the assault as vigorously as before, and all the defenders had received more or less serious wounds from the spears.  ""The others ought to have been here, long before this,"" Reuben said, ""if they had followed my instructions. I only hope they have not been attacked, too; but as we don't hear any firing, that can hardly be so.""  ""I hope they will be up before dusk,"" Dick Caister said. ""It will be dark in another half an hour. These fellows are only waiting for that to make a rush. If they do, it is all up with us.""  ""They will find it a tough job, even then,"" Reuben said; ""but the others must be here long before that. I told them to keep within two miles of us. They have had time to ride double that distance, since we made the smoke for them.""  Another ten minutes elapsed.  ""Hurrah!"" Reuben exclaimed, ""I can hear the trampling of horse's hoofs. The moment they arrive, make a rush for your horses and charge.""  ""I am afraid the horses are killed,"" Dick said ruefully.  ""In that case,"" Reuben said, ""we must get to our feet, and pick off the blacks as they run. They will get up like a covey of partridge, as the horsemen come among them.""  A loud cheer was heard, and the little party, with an answering shout, sprang to their feet and, rifle to shoulder, stood expecting the blacks to rise; but the ears of the natives were sharper than those of the whites, and they had begun to crawl away before the latter heard the approaching horsemen.  Finding this to be the case, the party ran to their horses. Four exclamations of wrath and grief were heard, for seven of the horses were completely riddled with spears.  Tartar, however, at his master's voice, struggled to rise to his feet. Reuben, aided by Jim, quickly threw off the hobbles; and leaped on to its back as it rose to its feet, just as Mr. Blount, with his party, rode up.  ""Keep close together,"" Reuben exclaimed, as he dashed forward, ""we may find some of the scoundrels.""  But the chase was in vain. It was already growing dusk, and there was no saying in which direction the natives had crawled away in the bush. After riding for a mile, Reuben reined in his horse.  ""It is no use,"" he said; ""we may as well get back to the fire.  ""What made you so late, Mr. Blount? We were fighting for three quarters of an hour, before you came up.""  ""I am very sorry,"" Mr. Blount replied; ""somehow or other, we went wrong altogether. There is nothing to guide one in this flat bush, and the tracker who was leading the way said he was certain he was going as you ordered him. Just before six o'clock we halted, and looked in the direction in which we expected to see your smoke, but there were no signs of it. Presently one of the constables exclaimed:  ""'There's the smoke, sir, right behind us.'  ""I looked around and, sure enough, there was a column of smoke, and a long way off it was.  ""'What have you been doing, you rascal?' I said to the black. 'There's the smoke right behind us. You have been leading us wrong, altogether.'  ""The black insisted that he was right, and that the fire must have been made by the black fellows. I didn't know what to make of it. It was two or three minutes past six; and I noticed, when we halted before, that your watch was exactly with mine. So I said to the men:  ""'We will wait five minutes longer and, if we see no other smoke, you may be sure that that is made by Captain Whitney.'  ""We waited the five minutes, and then I gave the word to start, when one of the men exclaimed:  ""'The black fellow's gone.'  ""Sure enough, he had slipped away without being noticed, while we were looking for the smoke. I felt sure, now, that something must be wrong; and we galloped towards your smoke, as fast as the horses could lay their feet to the ground. When we were about half way, we heard the sound of firing, and I can tell you that we didn't lose a moment on the way, after that. Have you had any losses?""  ""Two of the constables are killed,"" Reuben said, ""and we have all got some more or less ugly scratches. My left arm is useless for a time, I am afraid. A spear went right through it. I fear some of the others have worse hurts.""  ""What can have become of the sergeant's party?"" Mr. Blount said.  ""They must have gone the wrong way, too,"" Reuben replied. ""I told you I suspected those trackers of being in league with the blacks, and I have no doubt your fellow led you purposely astray, in order to give them an opportunity of cutting us off before you could arrive to our assistance. I suppose the other party has been misled in the same way. It is fortunate, indeed, that you made up your mind to ride for our smoke when you did. A quarter of an hour later, and you would have found only our bodies, and would probably have been ambushed in turn.""  ""Yes, it has been a close thing, indeed,"" Mr. Blount said. ""I was wrong, after what you told me, to trust that black scoundrel so entirely; but I own it never entered my mind that he was leading us astray.""  By this time they had reached the fire, which was blazing high.  ""How are you all?"" Reuben asked. ""Nobody badly hurt, I hope?""  ""Nothing very bad, captain,"" Dick Caister replied cheerfully. ""We have all had our skin ripped up a bit, but nothing very deep. That dodge of the saddles, of your black fellow, saved us. Mine was knocked over half a dozen times by spears, each of which would have done its business, if it hadn't been for it. I owe him my life so completely, that I forgive him for making our horses a barricade, to save yours.""  Reuben laughed. He had noticed, when he ran for his horse, that Jim had thrown him in the centre of the others: and their bodies completely sheltered him from the spears of the natives.  ""It was not fair, perhaps,"" he said; ""but my horse would have been killed, as well as yours, had he not done so; and Jim loves him almost as well as he does me. He has watched over and guarded him for the last three years.""  ""I am not angry with him,"" Dick said. ""Nothing could have saved our horses from being killed, and if one was to be saved, it is as well it should be Tartar, and not one of the others, as yours was far the most valuable of the five.""  ""Pile on the bushes,"" Reuben said to one of the constables. ""Make as big a blaze as you can. It will act as a beacon to the sergeant and his party.""  Half an hour later the trampling of horses' hoofs was heard and, a few minutes later, the sergeant and his party rode up.  ""I am sorry I am so late, sir,"" the sergeant said. ""Somehow or other we went wrong altogether, and saw nothing of your smoke. I was afraid something was wrong, but did not know what to do; so we halted till it came on dark, and presently made out a fire; but it was miles away, and right in the direction from which we had come. I did not think it could be you but, whether it was you or the blacks, that was the place to ride to.""  ""Have you got the tracker with you, sergeant?""  ""Yes, sir; at least, I saw him trotting ahead, ten minutes ago. Why, where has he got to?""  The tracker was not to be seen.  ""He has made off to join the blacks, I expect,"" Reuben said. ""You have been led astray purposely. We have been attacked, and Brown and Simpson are killed.""  An exclamation of rage broke from the men, who were in the act of dismounting.  ""I expect,"" Reuben said, turning to Mr. Blount, ""that the fellows noticed the talk I had with Jim, before we turned back from the false trail, and concluded that we had some suspicion that they were in league with the blacks; and so, when the party separated, they determined to lead the two flanking columns astray, so as to give their friends a chance of attacking us, and then to bolt.""  ""I expect that is it,"" Mr. Blount agreed. ""And now, the first thing is to get something to eat. When that is done, we will have a consultation.""  While the meat was cooking over the fire, Reuben told off a party of eight men to bury the bodies of the two constables who had fallen. The task was speedily completed, two holes being easily scraped in the light, sandy soil.  After supper was over, the settlers gathered round Reuben.  ""Now, captain, what do you mean to do?"" Mr. Blount asked. ""I have given up all hope of seeing my sheep again, so don't let them influence you, but just do as you think best. The blacks are in strong force, that is evident; and it will be a serious business pursuing them any further, in their own country.""  ""I am going to pursue them till I catch them,"" Reuben said; ""that is to say, as long as there is a sheep track to serve as a guide. I don't ask you, gentlemen, to go further, for I know it is a serious risk; but it is my duty to hunt those fellows down, and give them a lesson, and I mean to do it. We shall never have safety in the settlements, until those fellows come to understand that, whenever they attack us, they will be hunted down.""  ""I think you are right,"" Dick Caister said, ""and as long as you go on, I go with you for one, whatever comes of it. But how I am to go without my horse, I don't know.""  ""There are the spare horses,"" Reuben said; ""Fortunately we have still got six of them.""  ""So we have,"" Dick exclaimed joyfully. ""I had forgotten all about them. What luck, our bringing them with us!""  The other settlers all announced their intention of continuing the chase, as long as Reuben was willing to push on.  ""I will tell you what my idea is,"" Reuben said. ""The horses are already worn out and, by the end of another day, they will be half mad with thirst. I propose that we take two days' supply for ourselves, in our water bottles; and that we push forward on foot, sending two of the constables back to the stream, with our horses. I propose that we should push forward tonight. I expect the track we are following is the true one, and the stars will do as a guide.  ""At daybreak we will lie down in the bushes. The blacks will probably leave some fellows behind, as scouts. They, seeing nothing of us, will suppose we have given it up and gone home, and they will make but a short journey. At night we will go on again, and the chances are that, before morning, we shall catch sight of their fires, and will fall upon them at daylight. What do you think of the plan?""  ""I think it is a good one,"" Mr. Blount said, warmly. ""A capital plan. Of course we don't much like leaving our horses, for in this country one almost lives on horseback. Still, it will be the best plan, certainly; for as you say, the poor brutes will be half mad, by tomorrow night, with thirst.""  ""It will be a long tramp back again,"" a settler said dismally.  ""We won't tramp all the way,"" Reuben said with a smile. ""Directly we have overtaken the blacks, and given them a lesson, I will send Jim back again for the horses. He can cover the ground at a wonderful pace, and coming back he will ride one of them, and help the two constables to keep them together. They will have had two days' rest, and plenty of food and water, and will meet us before we get halfway back. There will be no fear of the blacks attacking them.""  All agreed that the plan was excellent, and half an hour later the whole party--with the exception of the two constables, who were to start at daybreak with the horses, for the river--set out on their march. The sky was cloudless, and the stars would have been a sufficient guide, even had they not had Jim with them. The black, however, took his place at the head of the party, and strode along as unhesitating as if it had been broad daylight.    Chapter 12: The Bush Rangers.   Scarce a word was spoken as the little party marched along. It was possible, although very improbable, that the natives, on scattering before the charge of Mr. Blount and his companions, might have left some of their number behind, to watch the movements of their pursuers. They would, however, certainly not anticipate the whites pushing forward that night. The fire had been piled high, the last thing before leaving, and the two men left there were told to keep it burning brightly till morning, and to start before anyone watching in the distance would be able to see whether the horses were mounted, or not. Should any natives approach the fire, after they had gone, they would take it for granted that the whole party had ridden back to the settlement.  All night, Reuben and his companions marched steadily forward; and were glad to throw themselves down on the ground, at the first appearance of daybreak. Four sentries were placed, with strict orders to keep a bright lookout through the bushes, but on no account to raise their heads above their level; and, arrangements having been made for their relief, every two hours, the rest of the party were soon sound asleep.  Except to relieve the sentries, there was no stir among them until late in the afternoon. Then there was a general movement, and soon all were sitting up, and appeasing their appetite upon the cold meat and dampers they had brought with them.  ""There is no harm in a pipe, I suppose, captain?"" Dick Caister said laughingly.  ""No, I think we can risk that,"" Reuben replied. ""The eyes of the savages may be wonderfully keen, but they would be a great deal sharper than I can give them credit for, were they to notice the smoke of a dozen pipes, curling up among the bushes.""  ""I suppose, Mr. Blount,"" Reuben said as, after the meal was finished, the party lighted their pipes and drew closely round the fire, ""you have heard of a good many bad businesses, with the blacks and bush rangers, in your time?""  ""I have, indeed,"" Mr. Blount replied. ""In the early days, the settlers had a hard time of it with the blacks; who were, of course, stronger than they are now and, after they had got over their first fear of firearms, more fearless of the whites. The bush rangers too were, when first they began to send convicts here, more numerous than at present. I do not know that they were as desperate as they are now--not so ready to take life, without provocation. You see, there was a very much larger run of country open to them; and many convicts who escaped, and took to the bush, were content to have gained their freedom. Some of them took black gins, and never troubled the colonists again; beyond, perhaps, coming down to a station and carrying off a sheep or two, or a bullock, when they got sick of kangaroo meat and wanted a change.  ""You see, the first settlers were generally poor and hard-working men. Young men with a little capital had not as yet been attracted here, so there was but little inducement for the escaped convicts to meddle with them. There were, of course, some notorious scoundrels, who seemed to murder for the pure love of the thing. The worst of them, I think, was a fellow who went by the name of Cockeye. What his real name was, I never heard.  ""That man was a perfect devil; and was, for a long time, the terror of the settlers. He never worked with other white men, but lived among the blacks. Of course, in those days the police system was in its infancy, and we had to rely upon ourselves. I had a narrow escape, once, of losing my life, from him and his blacks.  ""When I was about seventeen, I lived with my father and mother in a station about fifty miles from Sydney, or as it was called then Port Jackson. It was at that time quite an outlying station. We had two convicts allotted to us, both of them honest fellows enough, who had been transported for poaching or something of that kind--anyhow, they were not old hands, and gave no trouble. My father was a kind master, and we always felt that, in case of need, we could rely upon them just as upon ourselves. In those days it was next to impossible to get hired hands for, as there was plenty of land for anyone to squat upon, comparatively close to the port, the men who came out generally set up for themselves, at once.  ""One day I had been out on horseback, to look for a couple of bullocks which had strayed away; and was on my way back when, ahead of me, I heard the cooey of the blacks. I didn't think much of it, because they were common enough at that time, and a party had made a sort of encampment at a stream, about a mile from the house; but when, a minute later, I heard a gun fired, I guessed that there was mischief.  ""The sound seemed to come from away towards the right, where I knew that one of our men was out, herding the bullocks; so I clapped spurs to my horse, and rode in that direction. When I got near, I saw the cattle running wildly about, and a mob of black fellows among them. I could see no signs of our man, and guessed that he must have gone down; and that I had best ride and warn them, at the house.  ""The blacks saw me, and started at a run in my direction, but I soon left them behind. I was within a quarter of a mile of the house, when a native yell burst out ahead of me, followed by two shots. I rode on and, when I got near the house, saw a lot of black fellows round it.  ""Then came a flash from one of the upper windows, and I saw one of them roll over. That was a satisfaction, for I knew they hadn't caught my father asleep. I knew the doors and shutters were strong, and that he could make a good fight of it. Still, there was only him and my mother at home, for both the men had gone out before I left in the morning; and one man hasn't much chance of holding a house, attacked on all sides. So I made up my mind to try to dash through them, when the shutter opened a little, and my father shouted out:  ""'Ride for help, Bill. I will keep them off, till you get back.'  ""So I turned; but when I had gone a few yards I looked over my shoulder, and I saw a man dash out from behind the house on horseback, and start at a gallop after me. It was a bay with a white leg, and I knew that Cockeye used to ride such a horse, and that there wasn't a better in the colony. Almost at the same moment I heard a shot again, but I didn't look round.  ""I can tell you I felt pretty badly frightened, for there was no mercy to be expected from that scoundrel, and I knew that he was a good deal better mounted than I was. The next station was about four miles off, and I had about two hundred yards start, but before I had gone half a mile, he was within fifty yards of me. I could hear him, cursing and swearing and shouting to me to stop, but I had made up my mind I would not do that.  ""I had got a brace of pistols with me, but I wasn't much of a shot. I had, soon after I started, pulled them out of the holsters and shoved them into my belt in front of me; so that, as he came up, he shouldn't see my hand go down for them. My hope was that he would ride straight up to the side of me, not knowing that I was armed; and that would give me a chance of suddenly letting fly at him.  ""You would think the chance was a poor one; and that he would, to a certainty, shoot me down before he got up. I did not much think he would do that, for I guessed that the scoundrel would do with me as he had in some other cases; namely, take me and carry me back to the house, and there either threaten to shoot me, or hang me up over a fire, or some such devilry, to make those inside give in. I was determined this shouldn't be, and that if I could not shoot him I would be shot myself; for otherwise he would have got my father and mother, and it would have been three lives instead of one.  ""Presently--crack!--came the sound of a pistol, and I heard the bullet whiz close by. I expect that it was only to frighten me into stopping; but in a second or two he fired again, and the shot just grazed my shoulder, so he was in earnest that time.  ""I bent low on my saddle, got a pistol out of my belt, and prepared. There was another shot, the horse gave a spring and I knew he was hit, but for a time he went faster than ever; still, the last shot wasn't from more than twenty yards behind; and I expected, every minute, to see his horse's head coming up beside me. Then I heard a curse and a sudden fall and, looking round, saw his horse was down.  ""Cockeye was on his feet in a moment, and drew another pistol from his holster; so I concluded to keep on as hard as I could go, without waiting to make inquiries. I guessed pretty well what had happened. The shot I had heard my father fire, as he started after me, had hit the horse; and the poor brute had kept on until he dropped. I understood the fellow's firing, now. He felt his horse was failing under him, and his only chance was to stop me.  ""I kept on till I got safe to the station. The three men there started in different directions, to fetch assistance, and by the evening we had a score of men assembled there, and started back to our station. We heard a cooey when we were within a mile of the place, and guessed it was a fellow on the watch. By the time we got there they had all cleared off, but it was a close thing.  ""My mother was a courageous woman, and had defended the back of the house, and my father the front. The blacks had made several attempts to burn the place down; but the roof, like the walls, was made of solid timber; which is the only safe way to build a house, when you are exposed to attacks of the blacks.  ""As long as daylight lasted the old people had done very well, and had kept the blacks at a distance; and we saw, by the marks of blood in the morning, that they must have killed or wounded eight or ten of them; but if we hadn't come up before the blacks had darkness to cover them, it would have gone hard with them. Of course we knew that, and calculated so as to get there before nightfall.""  ""What became of the bush ranger?"" Reuben asked.  ""Well, curiously enough, that was the last time he ever troubled the settlements. We never knew exactly what became of him, but it was said that the blacks killed and eat him. I know that was very often the end of those fellows. As long as all went on well, the blacks were friendly enough with them, and were glad to follow their lead; but after a repulse like that they got at our station, or perhaps as a result of some quarrel about the division of the plunder, or their gins, or something of that sort, they would fall suddenly on their white friends, and make cooked meat of them.""  ""I suppose the blacks seldom spare any whites who fall into their hands?"" Reuben asked.  ""Scarcely ever,"" Mr. Blount replied. ""That was why they were more dreaded than the bush rangers. The latter would kill, if they were in the humour for it; but if there was no serious resistance, and none of their number got hurt, more often than not they contented themselves by leaving everyone tied, hand and foot, till somebody came to unloose them.  ""I remember one horrible case, in which they so tied up three white men at a lonely station, and nobody happened to go near it for three weeks afterwards. It struck someone that none of them had been seen, for some time; and a couple of men rode over and, to their horror, found the three men dead of hunger and thirst.  ""Now the black fellows don't do that sort of thing. When they do attack a station and take it, they kill every soul; man, woman, and child.""  ""I suppose, in that affair you were telling us of,"" Reuben asked, ""both of your ticket-of-leave men were killed?""  ""Yes. One seemed to have been surprised and speared at once. The other had made a stout fight of it, for the bodies of three natives were found near him.""  ""I remember one case,"" one of the others said, ""in which the blacks did spare one of the party, in a station which they attacked. It was a little girl of about three years old. Why they did so I don't know; perhaps the chief took a fancy to her. Maybe he had lost a child of the same age, and thought his gin would take to the little one. Anyhow, he carried her off.  ""The father happened to be away at the time. He had gone down to Sydney with a waggon, for stores; and when he got back he found the house burned, and the bodies of his wife, two boys, and two men, but there was no trace of that of the child.  ""He was nearly out of his mind, poor fellow. The neighbours all thought that the body must have been burned with the house; but he would have it that there would have been some sign of her. No one else thought so; and besides, it wasn't the custom of the blacks to carry off anyone. The father got a party to try and follow the blacks, but of course it was no use. They had pretty near two days' start.  ""The father never took to his farm again, but hung about the out stations, doing a job here and there for his grub. Sometimes he would be away for a bit, and when he came back, though he never talked about it, everyone knew he had been out hunting the blacks.  ""I do not know how many of them he killed, but I know he never spared one, when he got him outside the settlement. After a time the blacks never troubled that part. So many of them had been killed that they got a superstitious fear of the man, and believed he was possessed of an evil spirit; and I don't believe twenty of them, together, would have dared to attack him.  ""At last, from some of the half-tamed blacks in the settlement, he got to hear some sort of rumour that there was a white girl, living with one of the tribes far out in their country, and he set out. He was away four months, and he never said what he had been doing all the time. In fact, he started almost directly for the port, and went home by the next ship.  ""However, he brought his child back with him. It was four years since she had been carried off, and she was a regular little savage, when she arrived in the settlement with him. Of course she could not speak a word of English, and was as fierce as a little wildcat. I expect she got all right, after a bit.  ""I didn't see the man, but I heard he was worn to a shadow, when he got back. He must have had an awful time of it, in the bush. What with hunger and thirst, and dodging the blacks, I don't know how he lived through it; but he looked contented and happy, in spite of his starvation, and they say it was wonderful to see how patient he was with the child.  ""They got up a subscription, at Sydney, to send them both home. I heard that the captain of the ship he went in said, when he came back the next voyage, that the child had taken to him, and had got civilized and like other children before they got to England.""  ""Of course, such fellows as Cockeye and Fothergill are the exceptions, and not the rule,"" Mr. Blount said. ""Were there many of such scoundrels about, we should have to abandon our settlements and make war upon them; for there would be no living in the colony till they were exterminated. Most of these fellows are the colonial version of the highwaymen, at home. It is just 'Stand and deliver.' They content themselves with taking what they can find in a traveller's pockets, or can obtain by a flying visit to his station.""  ""Yes, I had several of those in my last district,"" Reuben said. ""They were just mounted robbers, and gave us a good deal of trouble in hunting them down. But none of them had shed blood during their career, and they did not even draw a pistol when we captured them. That style of bush ranger is a nuisance, but no more. Men seldom carry much money about with them here, and no great harm was done.""  ""You see,"" Dick Caister said, ""these fellows have a remarkable objection to putting their necks in the way of a noose; so that although they may lug out a pistol and shout 'Bail up!' they will very seldom draw a trigger, if you show fight. So long as they do not take life they know that, if they are caught, all they have to expect is to be kept at hard work during the rest of their sentence, and perhaps for a bit longer. They don't mind the risk of that. They have had their outing, sometimes a long one; but if they once take life, they know its hanging when they are caught; and are therefore careful not to press too hard upon their triggers.  ""But once they have killed a man, they don't generally care how many more lives they take. They are desperate, then, and seem to exult in devilry of all kinds. As to being stuck up by an ordinary bush ranger, one would think no more of it than of having one's pockets picked, in England.  ""It's lucky for us, on the whole, that the black fellows have such a hatred of the white men. Were it not for that, a good many of these fellows would go all lengths, relying on taking to the bush when they had made the colony too hot to hold them. But there are only a few of them that have ever got on well with the blacks, and many a man who has gone out into the bush has found his end there. You see, there's no explaining to a dozen natives, who jump up and begin to throw spears and boomerangs at you, that you are a bad white fellow, and not a colonist on the search for fresh runs.  ""No, the bush rangers on the whole are not such a bad lot of fellows. I suppose there is not one of us, here, who hasn't had men ride up and ask for food; who were, he knew pretty well, bush rangers. Of course they got their food, as anyone else would who rode up to a station and asked for it.  ""Once, only, I was told to hand over any money I had in the house. As, fortunately, I had only a few pounds I gave it up without making a fight for it. It's no use risking one's life, unless for something worth fighting for. I suppose most of us here have had similar experiences.""  There was a general chorus of assent among the settlers.  ""Many of them are poor-spirited wretches. Two of them bailed up a waggoner of mine, coming out with a load from the port. He pretended to give in and, as they were opening some of the boxes, he knocked one over with the butt end of his whip. The other fired a hasty shot, and then jumped on to his horse and galloped off again; and my man brought in the fellow he had stunned.""  ""Did you hand him over to the police?"" Reuben asked.  ""Not I,"" the settler laughed. ""I thought he had got what he deserved, so I bandaged up his head and let him go. Those poor beggars of convicts have a dreadful hard time of it, and I don't think there are many settlers who would hand over any man who had escaped, and taken to the bush, even if he had occasionally bailed up a waggoner or so. We know what a flogging the poor wretch would get and, as long as it's only an occasional robbery, to keep themselves from starving, we don't feel any great animosity against them. It's different, altogether, when they take to murder. Then, of course, they must be hunted down like wild beasts.  ""And now I vote that we have a nap. My pipe's out, and I suppose we shall be on the tramp again, as soon as it is dark.""    Chapter 13: Bush Rangers.   As soon as it became dark, the journey was renewed.  ""Now, Jim, you must keep your eyes well open,"" Reuben said. ""There is no saying when we may come upon them, now.""  ""I tink dey not berry far off, sah. Dose sheep too tired to go far. Black fellow glad to stop and rest, when he see no one coming after him.  ""De ground more up and down here. Must no make noise. May come upon dem sudden.""  It was nearly midnight when Jim suddenly halted.  ""What is it, Jim?"" Reuben asked, in a low voice.  Jim stood sniffing the air.  ""Me smell fire, captain.""  Reuben sniffed the air, but shook his head.  ""I don't smell anything, Jim.""  ""I smell him, sah, sure enough; not very close, perhaps, but in de air.""  ""What is it, Captain Whitney?"" Mr. Blount asked, as he came forward and joined them.  ""Jim says he smells fire, but I can't smell it.""  ""Oh, you can trust Jim's nose,"" the settler said. ""It is wonderful how keen is the scent of these natives. They are like dogs in that respect; and can perceive the smell of a fire, when the wind brings it down to them, miles away.""  ""Dis way now, sah,"" Jim said, turning off to the left, at right angles to the course which they had been pursuing. ""Smell come down the wind, dat's sartin. We follow him far enough, we sure to catch dem.""  For fully two miles, Reuben followed the black without speaking. Then he said:  ""I don't smell any smoke, Jim. Are you quite sure you are right about it?""  ""Quite sure, sah. De smoke much stronger than he was. Some of dese bushes make very sharp smell; can smell him very far away.""  ""That's all right, Jim, on we go then. I must take your word for it.""  After another half-an-hour's walking, Reuben thought that he too could smell an odour of burning wood and, soon afterwards, he became convinced that it was so. The ground on which they were crossing was slightly undulated and, on nearing the crest of one of the slight rises, Jim said:  ""De smoke am getting strong now, sah; and Jim can hear de bleating of de sheep. If de captain will wait here, Jim will go on ahead, and find out where dey lie.""  ""But perhaps you won't be able to find us again.""  ""Der no fear of dat, sah. But if I not come straight back, I give a little whistle-like this--when I get on to a rise; and if the captain answer in just the same way, then I come straight back to him.""  So saying, Jim glided away in the darkness; while Reuben gave the word for the men to halt, and lie down till his return. There was, however, no occasion for a signal for, in little over half an hour from the time of Jim's leaving, he rejoined them again; his coming being unnoticed until he stood among them, so noiseless were his footsteps.  ""We hab dem dis time, sure enough, captain.""  ""Why, is that you, Jim? You quite startled me. Well, what is your news?""  ""De black fellows and de sheep are a little over a mile away, sah. Dey got a big fire down in a bottom. Some of dem eating still, but most of dem fast asleep round de fire.""  ""How many are there of them?""  ""About fifty, sah--at least, dat about the number Jim saw. I expect I was right when I tell you dat there was well nigh a hundred, at fust. Some ob them go off wid de sheep, de odder way, and we kill over twenty in dat fight.""  ""Do you think we killed so many as that, Jim?""  ""I went round, sah, and counted sixteen of dem; and some sure to have crawl away and die in de bush. Dere were over twenty killed altogether, for sure; and I specks dat some more hab left de party today, and gone off wid dere share of de sheep to der people.""  ""Well, what do you think, Mr. Blount--shall we attack them tonight, or wait till morning?""  ""I should say wait till morning, certainly,"" the settler said. ""We might shoot a few if we attack them now, but the rest would be all off, at the first flash of our gun; and we should never get another shot. I think our best plan would be to remain where we are, for another couple of hours--it is two o'clock now--then Jim will guide us to the place, and we can take up our position as close as we can get, and wait for daylight.""  ""There is no fear of their making a move before it is light, Jim?""  ""No, sah. Dey tink dey am safe now, and eat one big feast. Dey not move till light, sartain.""  ""Very well, Mr. Blount, then we will do as you say. When we get near them we will divide into four parties. You, with four men, shall move up close to the sheep, Sergeant O'Connor, with four others, shall work up from the other end of the bottom. Five others shall make a detour, and get right on the other side of their fire; and I, with the other three and Jim, who you see has got one of the constables' rifles and ammunition, will come down on them from this side.  ""Jim will place all the parties, taking them by turns, as near the fire as he thinks safe; and will then return to me. Only, as we shall attack them from four sides, let everyone be careful about his shooting; otherwise we shall have casualties from our own shots.  ""All will remain quiet until I fire. Then a general volley must be poured in, with bullet and buckshot; and when the rifles and guns are empty, go right at them with pistol and sword.""  The plan was carried out as arranged and, before daybreak, the four parties were lying in the positions allotted to them, within forty yards of the blacks. A few of these were seen sitting by the fire, the rest were all asleep.  Gradually the light began to creep over the sky and, as it became lighter, there was a movement among the blacks. As soon as he could see perfectly, Reuben was about to fire in the air; for he did not like to fire at unsuspecting men, in spite of the deeds of blood and rapine they had performed in the settlement.  Presently, however, his eye fell upon one of the treacherous trackers, who had so nearly brought destruction upon them. He levelled his rifle and fired, and the man fell dead in his tracks.  As the rest of the blacks leapt to their feet, a volley from nineteen guns was poured into them--followed by seven or eight more, as most of the settlers were armed with double-barrelled guns; a few buckshot being dropped into each barrel, over the bullets. Then came the sharp cracks of the pistols, as the whites rushed down to the assault.  The natives attempted no resistance. Panic stricken at the sudden appearance of the foe, whom they imagined by this time far back on their way to the settlements; and paralysed by the slaughter made by the first volley, they thought only of flight. A few caught up their spears and waddies, as they made a dash for the bushes, and strove to effect their escape between the parties advancing on each side of them; but the latter were now close at hand and, for a minute or two, a fight took place between the whites, with their clubbed muskets, and the natives with their spears and waddies. But it was soon over, for the natives only fought to escape and, as soon as they saw an opening, bounded away into the bushes.  Only one of the assailants was killed, but several were more or less severely wounded by the spears; while no less than thirty-four of the blacks were killed. The victors made no attempt at pursuit but, as soon as the last of the natives had escaped, they gathered to ascertain what loss had taken place, on their side.  ""Poor Phillips is killed,"" Mr. Blount said, as he examined the body. ""The spear has gone right through his throat. Fortunately he was a single man. He has only been out here a few months, and was staying down at Dick Caister's.""  ""Poor Tom,"" Dick said, in feeling tones. ""He was a capital young fellow, and I am deeply sorry. Fortunately he has left no one behind to grieve more than I do for him, for he lost his father and mother shortly before he came out, and was alone in the world.""  ""I am thankful it's no worse,"" Mr. Blount said. ""We have given the blacks a terrible lesson. I think, as far as they are concerned, we can sleep in peace for a long time. Of course we have not done with them, for they are very revengeful; but a blow like this will render them careful, for a long time, how they attack us.  ""How many of them have fallen?""  ""Thirty-four,"" Reuben said. ""Jim has just been counting them up.  ""Now, Mr. Blount, we will have another of your sheep for breakfast, and then we'll be off.""  The sheep had scattered somewhat, at the alarm of the fire, but were soon driven together again. One was caught and killed, and slices of the meat were stuck up on ramrods, and were soon frizzling before the fire.  ""Well, Mr. Blount, how many sheep do you think there are here?""  ""I have just been looking them over,"" the settler replied, ""and I should say there must be nearly twelve hundred; so that, allowing for two hundred driven off in the other direction, and a hundred dropped by the way, the whole flock are accounted for. I am indeed obliged to you, and to my friends here. I never expected to see a tail of them again, when I found they were off.""  ""I am very glad you have recovered so many of them,"" Reuben said, ""and still more, that we have given the blacks such a lesson. We will, as soon as we have finished, be on the march. Jim will go on ahead at once, as we agreed; and he tells me will get to the stream where the horses are before night, and will start out with them at once, so that we may be able to meet them tomorrow, early. I fancy our water bottles are all getting very low, but we can hold on for today.""  As soon as he had finished eating, Jim started off at a run, which Reuben knew he would keep up for hours. The body of young Phillips was buried; and then, collecting the flock and driving it before them, the rest started upon their return. The sheep could not travel fast, for many of them were footsore with their hurried journey; but they had found plenty of nourishment in the grass at the bottoms, and in the foliage of the bushes and, being so supplied, had suffered little from thirst.  Jim, before starting, had pointed out the exact line they were to follow, and this they kept by compass. With only one or two short halts, they kept on until nightfall and, leaving the sheep in a grassy bottom, lit their fire on the crest above it, in order that its flame might serve as a guide to Jim, should he get back with the horses before daylight.  There was but little talking, before each stretched himself at length before the fire. They had been twenty-four hours without sleep, and all were now suffering severely from thirst. The last drops in the water bottles had been emptied, early in the day; and they were parched not only by the heat of the sun, but by the stifling dust raised by the flock as they travelled.  There had been but little supper eaten. Indeed, most of them contented themselves with chewing pieces of raw meat, to satisfy their thirst rather than their hunger. Although they had no fear of the return of the natives, Reuben thought it only prudent to keep watch, and each of the party had half an hour on sentry duty.  The day was just beginning to break, when the man on guard exclaimed:  ""I can hear the trampling of horses!""  The news brought everyone to their feet, and in a few minutes the two constables and Jim rode up, driving before them the horses of the rest of the party.  ""Well done, Jim!"" Reuben exclaimed. ""Now, the first thing, get one of the water skins off.""  One of the skins was unfastened in a minute and, after copious draughts, everyone felt refreshed and ready for work again.  ""We cannot start for a few hours,"" Reuben said. ""The horses must have come over forty miles, and won't be fit to travel till the afternoon; fortunately there is plenty of grass for them in the bottom. And now that my thirst is allayed, I begin to discover that I am hungry.""  There was a general chorus of assent. The fire was made up again. The men went down to the bottom, and killed and brought up a sheep; and all were soon engaged in making up for their twenty-four hours' fast.  In the afternoon a start was made; but although they travelled all night, they did not reach the stream until the following afternoon, as they were obliged to accommodate their pace to that of the sheep. The following morning Reuben rode forward to the settlements, leaving Mr. Blount, with two of his friends, to come on with the flock at his leisure.  At the first farm he reached Reuben heard that, as he feared, the bush rangers had taken advantage of so many of the settlers being away to recommence their attacks. At the first two houses they visited, they had found the inmates on the watch, and had moved off without making any attack. At the third they had surprised and killed a settler, his wife, and two hired men, and had sacked and burned the house. Reuben learned that some of the police had gone off in pursuit.  Leaving his horse to the care of the settler, Reuben borrowed a fresh animal and rode off to the scene of the outrage, which was some thirty miles distant. Just as he arrived there he met the party of eight police, who had been in pursuit of the bush rangers, and they reported that they had lost all trace of them.  For the next two or three weeks Reuben did not return to his headquarters, spending the time in riding from station to station, with a small party of police, and urging upon the settlers the necessity not only of strongly barricading their houses, but of keeping a watch by turns; as the bush rangers seldom attack a place, unless they can gain the advantage of a surprise.  As nothing had been heard of the bush rangers, Reuben determined to return to his barrack. He was spending the last night at Dick Caister's when, just as they were about to turn in, the sound of a horse's hoofs, at full gallop, was heard.  ""Something is the matter,"" Dick said. ""Men don't ride like that, at night, for nothing.""  He went to the door and opened it, just as the horseman stopped in front.  ""Quick, Caister!"" the man said as he leaped down, ""the bush rangers are not fifty yards behind.""  And indeed, the sound of the trampling of other horses sounded close behind.  ""Come in, come in!"" Dick cried. ""Ah! Is it you, Shillito? Never mind the horse, he must look after himself. Luckily the captain's here, and we will give it them hot. Just run round and see that all the shutters are fastened.""  As Dick spoke he was barring the door, and he now shouted at the top of his voice to the two hired men, who were in bed upstairs; but before any answer could be returned, there was a thundering knocking at the door.  ""What is it?"" Dick shouted.  ""Open the door, and be quick about it, or it will be worse for you. We want that chap that's just ridden up, and we mean to have him, so he had best come out at once. If you don't open the door at once, we will cut the throats of every soul in the house.""  ""You have got to get at our throats first, my fine fellow,"" Dick said jeeringly.  The knocking was at once renewed, but with greater violence.  ""The door's a strong one,"" Dick said to Reuben, ""and it will stand a good deal of that sort of thing; but we may as well move the table and benches up against it, then we can see how things stand.""  Reuben had been busy taking down the guns, which hung over the fireplace; dropping a ramrod into them to see that they were charged, and putting fresh caps on to the nipples. His own rifle stood in the corner; and was, he knew, ready for service.  ""What arms have you altogether, Caister?""  ""I have that rifle and double-barrel gun. Both my hands have got muskets; I got them up from Sydney, a few months back.""  The two men now came running down from above, each with his musket.  ""Where is Jim?"" Reuben said, looking round.  ""He went out about ten minutes ago,"" Dick said. ""I fancy he went to look after your horse. He takes as much care of that animal as if it were a child.""  ""I hope they won't find him in the stable, and cut his throat,"" Reuben said. ""He is wonderfully faithful and attached to me. I would not have harm come to him, for anything.  ""Now, I will go upstairs and reconnoitre. Now those fellows have left off knocking at the door, they are a good deal more dangerous than when they were kicking up all the row.""  ""Mind how you show yourself, captain, as likely enough one of them is on the watch, expecting that we should be sure, sooner or later, to take a look out of that window. So keep well back. The night is pretty light, so I expect you will be able to make them out.""  ""Can we get a view of the stable from that window?""  ""Yes,"" Dick replied, ""I rather had that in my mind's eye, when I put the stable up. It's always a good thing, men knowing that their master can have an eye upon them, when they least expect it. Why do you ask?""  ""Because if the window commands the stable door, we can prevent them getting the horses out.""  ""Yes,"" Dick said, ""after losing two in that last affair, it would be a serious matter to have the rest of them carried off.""  Reuben went up the stairs and made his way towards the window, standing a short distance back. He could see no one moving about in the yard, and he was about to move close to it, when a tremendous crash took place below, followed by loud shouts. He ran downstairs again.  The bush rangers had moved round to the back of the house and, there picking up a young tree which had been brought in, to saw up into billets for firewood, they used it as a battering ram against one of the shutters; and at the very first blow broke it off its hinges, and then made a rush at the window. Two shots rang out almost together; and then, firing a hasty volley into the window, the bush rangers began to climb in. But by this time Reuben had arrived, and the sharp cracks of his pistols rang out.  ""They have got the police here!"" one of the men exclaimed, as he caught a sight of Reuben's uniform.  ""Draw off, lads, I expect it's that accursed captain,"" another voice exclaimed. ""He's always riding about, with nobody but that black fellow with him. He has got to go down, that fellow has, or he will give us no end of trouble; but draw off from that window, for a moment.""  ""What will they do next, I wonder?"" Dick Caister said as, leaving the two hands to guard the window, he returned into the other room with Reuben.  ""I rather expect they are going to try to burn us out. We must keep them from that, if we can.  ""Mr. Shillito, will you go up to the upper room, and keep an eye on the stables? Shoot down anyone who may pass your line of sight.  ""Haven't you got any loopholes, Caister?""  ""Yes, of course I have,"" Dick replied. ""I had forgotten all about them. Yes, there are two loopholes in the logs in each side of the house, upstairs. They have been shut up by wisps of straw, ever since the house was built.""  Giving strict orders, to the two men, to shout instantly if anyone moved near the window, the two young men went upstairs.  ""Have you seen anything, Shillito?""  ""Not a thing. One would almost think that they have bolted.""  ""They will hardly do that, I fancy,"" Reuben said. ""There are ten or twelve of them, but I think one or two must have got a bullet in them.""  ""I wish they would come on,"" Dick said, as he pulled out the straw from the loopholes.  Reuben went to them all in succession, and looked out, but nothing could be seen of their assailants. Presently, however, a number of dark figures appeared, each bearing a burden.  ""They have been cutting brush wood!"" Reuben exclaimed. ""I was right, you see. They are going to try to smoke or burn us out. Now I think it's time to give them a lesson.""  ""Look, look!""  The exclamation was excited by a sudden glare of light, on the other side of the stables.  ""The scoundrels have set fire to the stables!"" Shillito said.  ""What shall we do--make a sally?"" Caister asked. ""I am ready for it, if you think right.""  ""No,"" Reuben said, ""they would only shoot us down as we come out. They must guess that some of us are up at this window, or they would try to carry the horses off, instead of destroying them.  ""I only wish we were on the poor beasts' backs. We would go for them, though they were twice as many.  ""I don't see the others now--they must have gone round to the other side of the house.""  Scarcely had Reuben taken up his station, at one of the loopholes behind, than he again saw the dark figures. He took steady aim and fired. There was a sharp cry, and one of the fellows fell to the ground. The others at once threw down their burdens, and fled. Three minutes later there was a shout.  ""Look here, you policeman, and you, Caister, you shall pay dearly for this night's work. I swear it, and Bill Fothergill never forgets his word in that way. It's your turn, this time. It will be mine the next, and when it is, take care.""  The only reply was a shot from Reuben, aimed in the direction from which the voice came. A minute later there was a trampling of horses.  ""They are gone!"" Shillito exclaimed.  ""Perhaps it is only a trick, to draw us out,"" Dick suggested.  ""No, I don't think it's that,"" Reuben said. ""They are not strong enough to send a party off, and to attack us with the rest. No, I think they have gone. They know that we can't follow them.  ""They have taken good care of that,"" he added bitterly, as he glanced at the stables, which were now a sheet of flame. ""However, we will look round and see.""  The three men descended to the room below and, being joined by the two hands, removed the furniture piled against the door, and threw it open.  ""We mustn't go round to that side of the house, so as to get into the glare of the fire, till we have looked round,"" Reuben said. ""I believe they are all gone; but they may have left a couple of them lurking, somewhere about, to pick us off when we show in the light.  ""I will take one of your hands, Caister, and scout round on one side. Do you three go the other side.""  A quarter of an hour later the two parties met near the stables, where the fire was now burning low. The roof had fallen in, and only some of the uprights were erect, with flicking flames licking them as they stood glowing above the mass of still blazing debris.  ""I wonder whether that poor fellow is under that?"" Reuben said.  ""I hope not, indeed. I fancy he must have got away. He might have slipped off when they first rode up. He may be hiding somewhere round, afraid to come near till he knows how matters have turned out.""  So saying, he gave a loud cooey. They stood silent for a minute, but no answer came back.  ""There is nothing to be done, till morning,"" Dick said, ""and it's no use hanging about here. Before it gets light I will start for Watson's. There are two of your men there; and they, with the two Watsons and ourselves, can set out after these fellows, if you are agreeable. That is, as soon as we get hold of some horses.""  ""I hardly think I shall be justified in taking you,"" Reuben said, as he walked back towards the house. ""These scoundrels are all armed to the teeth, and they are first-rate shots. They know every foot of the country, and against anything like equal numbers they would make a desperate fight of it, even if they did not thrash us. Of course, in anything like an equal number of my own men I should not hesitate, but I don't think it will be fair for you settlers to undertake such a service as that.""  ""Listen!"" Shillito exclaimed, ""they are coming back again.""  Surely enough, on the night air the sound of horses, galloping at full speed, could be heard.  ""I don't think it can be them,"" Reuben said. ""They would have no motive in coming back, after they once rode off. They would know we should be ready for them.""  ""I don't see who else it can be. At any rate, all our guns are loaded; and if it is them, all the better.""  Suddenly a loud cooey was heard.  ""That's Jim!"" Reuben exclaimed. ""I should know his call among a thousand. He must have made off to get help at once, but I don't know how he can have done it in time.""  ""Why, it's the Watsons and my men!"" he exclaimed, as the party rode up into the light.  ""All safe?"" one of the settlers cried, as he jumped from his horse.  ""All safe, thank God,"" Reuben replied. ""Did Jim bring you news that we were attacked?""  ""Yes; fortunately we were sitting up late, talking, when he rode up; so there was not a minute lost.""  ""Rode up!"" Reuben repeated, in surprise; ""why, where did you get a horse, Jim?""  ""Rode master's horse,"" Jim said.  ""What!"" Reuben exclaimed in delight, ""what, is Tartar safe? I was afraid his body was under those ruins. Why, how did you get him out?""  ""Jim was in de stable, sah, when bush ranger ride up. De horses was stamping, and I not hear dem till dey come quite close, den it was too late to run out.  ""De moment dat dey began to make bobbery at door, I opened stable door and bring out de three horses.""  ""What! Did you get mine out, too?"" Dick shouted. ""Jim, you are a trump, and no mistake.""  ""Den,"" Jim went on, paying no attention to the interruption, ""me led de other two hosses little way, and let them go loose, sure not go far from home; and I jump on Tartar, and ride like de debel to Watson's for de police.""  ""Well done, Jim. You have done capitally. Now let us talk over what we had better do.""  The party re-entered the house. Fresh wood was thrown on to the fire, and one of Dick's hands proceeded to put food on the table, and prepare tea, while the others consulted what course should be pursued.  It was agreed, at once, that more aid would be necessary, before they could think of attacking the bush rangers; but all were ready to join in the hunt for them. Therefore it was decided that Dick Shillito and the two Watsons should each ride, at once, to neighbouring stations to bring aid. At one of the stations two more policemen would be found, and as in the pursuit they should probably pass near other stations, their numbers would swell as they went. When this was settled, the party sat down to the meal.  ""How did you come upon them, Shillito?"" Caister asked.  ""I had been spending the day with the Wilkinsons. I did not start to ride home till it was rather late, and I was riding fast when, about a quarter of a mile before I got to my place, I rode right into the middle of a lot of men on horseback. They evidently hadn't heard me coming, and were as much surprised as I was.  ""There was a general shout of 'Bail up!' and I saw at once what sort of gentry they were. However, I didn't stop, but in the confusion dashed through.  ""A few shots were fired at me. I suppose they were too surprised to aim straight. Then they started off after me. I knew it was no use making for home, for there was only one man there; so I swept round and made for your place. My horse is a good one, you know, and I gained on them all except one man, who must have been capitally mounted, for he gradually crept up to me. He wasn't twenty yards behind me when he shouted:  ""'Stop, or I fire!'  ""I pulled straight up and, as he came up to me, let fly at him. He tumbled off his horse, and I galloped off till I got here.""  ""What has become of your horse, I wonder?""  ""I gave him a cut with my whip, as I jumped off. He cantered away. Of course they may have caught him, but I don't think it's likely.""  ""You will find him somewhere about at daylight, I expect. I will ride Caister's spare horse, now.""  For Jim, with one of the hands, had gone out to fetch in the two horses from the spot where they had been turned loose.    Chapter 14: An Unexpected Meeting.   As soon as it was light the party were assembled and started, Jim leading the way, at a swinging pace which kept the horses going at a hand canter. The marks were, for a time, perfectly easy to follow. Five miles on the tracks led to a shepherd's hut. At their call, the man came out.  ""You had a visit from bush rangers last night?""  ""What if I did?"" the man replied gruffly. ""I can't help where the bush rangers pay their visits. Yes, they came in here and said they wanted some supper; and you may guess I did not keep them waiting long, for they were not in a particularly good temper. From what they said, three of their men had been killed.""  This was already known to the party, as Jim had found three bodies at a short distance from the house. Two of these had evidently been carried there from the back window, where they had been killed in trying to effect the entry. The other had been shot when approaching to fire the house.  ""The captain of the gang was terrible put out, and was a-cussing and swearing as to what he would do to those as did it. I wouldn't be in their shoes, if they were to fall into his hands.""  ""They didn't say anything which would give you an idea as to the direction they were taking?""  ""Not they,"" the man replied. ""You don't suppose they would be such fools as that and, if they had, you don't suppose as I should be such a fool to split on 'em. Not likely. I ain't no desire to wake up, one night, and find the door fastened outside and the thatch on fire.""  ""We may as well ride on,"" Reuben said. ""We shall learn nothing here. The fellow is a ticket-of-leave man, and as likely as not in league with these scoundrels.  ""I wonder what they came here for,"" he added, as they started again.  ""I tell you, sah,"" Jim said. ""Dat fellow has driven his herd ober their trail--all stamped out--no saying where they hab gone to.""  ""We must follow the herd, then,"" Reuben said. ""If we look sharp, we ought to be able to see the traces where they left them.""  Jim shook his head.  ""No find,"" he said decidedly. ""Plenty places where de ground am berry hard, and horse feet no show. Dey choose some place like dat and turn off; perhaps put rug under horses' feet, so as to make no mark. Me sarch, sah. Jim look him eyes very hard, but tink no find.""  And so, to their great disappointment, it turned out. They followed the tracks of the herd three miles, until they came upon them, quietly grazing; but nowhere could they see any trace of a party of horsemen turning off. All the party were greatly vexed at the ill success of their expedition; for all had hoped that they were, at last, going to overtake the gang who had done such mischief in the colony.  Reuben was especially disgusted. He had, only the day before, received a letter from his chief acknowledging the receipt of his report describing the pursuit of the blacks, and congratulating him warmly upon his success. The letter ended:  ""If you can but give as good an account of the bush rangers, we shall be indeed grateful to you. As it is, you have more than justified my selection of you for the post.""  Leaving two constables as guards, at Dick Caister's station, in case, as was probable enough, the bush rangers should return to take revenge for the repulse they had experienced there, Reuben rode back to his headquarters, from which he had now been absent some time. The evening after his return, he called Jim into his room.  ""Jim,"" he said, ""I want your advice as to the best way of finding out where these bush rangers are quartered. How do you think we had better set about it? Would it be of any use, do you think, for you to go among the natives and try and find out? There is no doubt they know, for they have often acted with the bush rangers. Do you think you could pass among them?""  ""No, sah,"" Jim said at once. ""Me no speak deir way. Me understand black fellow, me talk dar language, but not same way. They find out difference directly and kill me. De wild black fellows hate those who hab lived wid de white men. We hate dem just de same way. We say dem bad black fellow, dey say we no good.""  ""But those rascally trackers who led us wrong, that day of the fight, they were friendly with them.""  ""Yes, sah, but dey not so very long away from the bush, and always keep friends wid the others. Meet dem and talk to dem, and tell dem dey set the white men on wrong tracks.""  ""Well, Jim, but could not you do the same?""  ""No good, sah. Me brought up among de whites, eber since me little boy. Dey not believe me if I go and say dat to dem. Jim ready to get killed, if de captain want him; but no good at all him getting killed in dat way.""  ""I don't want you to get killed in any way, Jim, and if that's your opinion about it, we will give up the plan at once. Can you think of any other way?""  ""Me tink a lot about him. Me know de captain want very much to catch dose fellows, but Jim no see how dat can be done, for sure. But de best plan me can see is for Jim to go out by himself, and search de country outside white man's bounds. If he find de track of horses, he follow dem up. Me know about de way dey ride off after dey be killing people at de stations. If Jim look, and look, and look berry sharp he find dar track for sure; and once he find dem, he follow dem up. Must be water, for sure, where dey live. Dat good guide to begin with.  ""But captain must not hurry; Jim may be long time before he find dem, dar no saying how long. Captain wish Jim to go?""  ""Well, Jim, I don't want you to go; that is to say, I should miss you very much; but if you could find out the haunts of these scoundrels, you would be doing me a very great service, as well as the people of all the stations.""  ""Jim no care about oder people,"" the black said. ""He care for de captain, and will go out and try and find tracks.""  ""Be careful, Jim, and don't get into trouble with them. If you were to fall into their hands, and they were to find out you were connected with the police, they would shoot you like a dog.""  ""Dey won't find out. White man not understand. Black fellow all one to him. You hab no fear for Jim. Who look after hoss, while Jim away?""  ""I shall appoint one of the policemen as my orderly, Jim, and he will look after him.""  Jim made a contemptuous gesture, to signify that he had little confidence in the power of any white man to look after Tartar. For the rest of the evening Jim was occupied in cooking, and in the morning he was gone.  A week later, Reuben was among the outlying stations again. He had heard nothing of the bush rangers, and no fresh attacks had been made by them, since that upon Dick Caister's station.  One evening, just as he had gone up to bed, he was roused by a sharp knocking at the door of the house in which he was stopping. The settlers had grown cautious now, and an upper window was opened, and Reuben heard the questions, ""Who is there?"" and ""What is it?""  ""Is Captain Whitney here?""  ""Yes, do you want him?""  ""Yes, I want to see him directly.""  In a minute, Reuben had opened the door.  ""I am Captain Whitney,"" he said. ""What is it?""  ""I am glad I have found you, sir. They told me at the next station you were here yesterday, but they did not know whether you were here now.  ""Well, sir, I am shepherding some twenty miles away; and this afternoon, just as I had got back to my hut, in runs a black fellow. It is a lonely spot, and I reached for my gun, thinking there was more of them, when he said:  ""'No shoot, me friend. Me sarve Captain Whitney of de police. You know him?'  ""I said I had heard your name.  ""'You know where he is?' the black asked.  ""I said I did not know for certain; but that when my mate went in for grub, two days before, he had heard say that you had been along there that morning.  ""The black said: 'Good. You run and find him.'  ""'Thank you,' says I. 'What for?'  ""'I find out about the bush rangers,' he said. 'You go and tell captain dat, tomorrow morning before de day begins, dey attack the station of Donald's.'  ""'Are you quite sure?' says I.  ""'Quite sure,' says the black. 'Me heard dem say so.'  ""So as I hates the bush rangers like poison, I saddles up and rides into the station; and when I had told the boss, he said I better ride and find you, if I could. You would be at one of the stations this way. I stopped at three of them, and at the last they told me you was here.""  ""Thank you greatly, my good fellow. Donald's! I don't know the name. Where do they live?""  ""They have only been here a couple of months,"" Reuben's host, who was standing beside him, replied. ""They bought that station of Anderson's. He was a chicken-hearted young fellow, and sold out because of the bush rangers. There is a man, his wife, and her sister, I believe. I fancy they have got a pretty fair capital. They took Anderson's stock, and have been buying a lot more. That's why the bush rangers are going to attack them.""  ""I thought,"" Reuben said, ""that Anderson's was not one of the most exposed stations.""  ""No, that was what everyone told him, before he sold it.""  ""How far would you say it was from here?""  ""Thirty-five miles,"" the settler said. ""It's ten miles from Barker's, and I reckon that's twenty-five from here.""  ""Well, of course I shall ride at once; as there are women there, it makes the case all the more urgent. I have got my orderly, and there are two more men at the station, this side of Barker's.""  ""I will go, of course,"" Reuben's host said, ""and will bring two men with me.  ""You had best stop here for the night,"" he added, turning to the shepherd. ""You have ridden pretty well thirty miles already, and that at the end of your day's work.""  ""Not I,"" the man replied. ""Jim Walsh is not going to be lying in bed, with the thought of two women in the hands of them murderous bush rangers. You might lend me a fresh horse, if you have got one. If not, I must try and pick one up at one of the stations, as we go along.""  ""I have plenty of horses in the yard,"" the settler said.  ""Well, let us be off as soon as possible,"" Reuben put in. ""It's past twelve o'clock now, and we have thirty-five miles to ride, and to stop at two or three places, so we haven't a minute to lose.""  In a few minutes the horses were saddled, and the six men dashed off at full gallop. At three stations, which they passed on the way to Barker's, they picked up seven more. There was but little delay as, the instant the news was told, the men hurried up, saddled their horses, and rode after the party, who pushed straight on when they had told their story. At Barker's they were joined by Barker himself, and two men. Two constables had also been picked up on the way.  The others overtook them here, and the party now numbered twenty men. There was a pause to allow all to come up, and to give the horses breathing time, for they had traversed twenty-five miles at a rapid pace, with scarce a halt.  Mrs. Barker herself prepared a meal, to which, while the horses got their breath, their riders did justice. Then they mounted again, and rode for Donald's.  ""It all depends,"" Reuben said, ""as to our being there in time, whether the man keeps a careful watch. If he does they may not attack till the doors are opened, and then make a sudden rush and catch them unawares. If, when they arrive there, they find the whole house is asleep, they may burst in at once.""  ""I think they will be careful,"" Mr. Barker said. ""I know Donald is very anxious; and no wonder, with two women with him, both young and pretty--quite out of the way, indeed. In fact, he told me the first day I rode over, he had no idea of the unsettled state of the district, and wouldn't have taken the place if he had, not even if Anderson had given it as a gift; and he wrote down at once to some agent, and told him to sell the place again, for whatever he can get for it; but I expect there will be some trouble in finding a purchaser. The district here has had a bad name for some time and, if Donald had not arrived fresh from England, he must have heard of it.  ""Listen! I thought I heard the sound of firing.""  There was a momentary pause, but no one could hear anything. Nevertheless, they went on at redoubled speed. They were now within three miles of the station.  Suddenly, on coming over a crest, a faint light was seen ahead. It increased rapidly, and a tongue of flame leapt up.  ""Come on, lads!"" Reuben exclaimed. ""The scoundrels are at their work.""  At a hard gallop they crossed the intervening ground, until they were within half a mile of the station, from which a broad sheet of flame was leaping up. Then Reuben drew rein, for he had outridden the rest of his party, and it was important that all should ride together.  ""Now,"" he said, when they were gathered; ""let us keep in a close body.  ""If they ride off as we arrive there, do you, Jones and Wilkins, stop at the station and see if you can render any help. If not, follow us at once.  ""Let the rest keep on with me, straight after the bush rangers. There is already a faint light in the east. In half an hour it will be broad day so, even if they have got a start, we shall be able to follow them. Now, come on.""  At the head of his party, Reuben rode at full speed down to the station. As he neared it he saw, to his satisfaction, that the flames arose from some of the outbuildings, and that the house itself was still intact; but as no firing had been heard, he hoped that it still resisted.  There was a shrill whistle, when the party approached within a hundred yards. Men were seen to dash out of the house, and to leap upon their horses.  With a shout, Reuben rode down. He did not pause for a moment, but dashed past the house in the direction in which the bush rangers had fled. They were, he knew, but a hundred yards ahead; but it was not light enough for him to see them, especially after riding through the glare of the fire. The sound of the horses' feet, however, afforded an indication; but as there was no saying in which direction they might turn, he was forced to halt, every two or three minutes, to listen.  To his mortification he found that, each time, the sound was getting more indistinct; for the speed at which they had travelled had taken so much out of the horses, that they were unable to compete with the fresher animals ridden by the bush rangers, who were all well mounted, many of the best horses in the district having been stolen by them. At last the sound could be heard no longer, and Reuben was reluctantly obliged to give the order to halt; for he feared he might override the trail.  ""It is no use,"" he said, as he reined in his horse. ""They will know as well as we do that they are out of hearing now, and might turn off anywhere. It is terribly annoying. We are too late to save the station, and the bush rangers have escaped.  ""However, we will take up their trail as soon as it is daylight. Indeed, I am expecting every moment to be joined by Jim, who is sure to be somewhere near, and can perhaps guide us direct to their hiding place.""  Deeply disappointed, the party dismounted from their horses.  ""The scoundrels must have had someone on the watch,"" Reuben said, ""or they would never have taken the alarm so soon. I am sorry, now, that we did not send a party round to the other side before we charged down upon them; but my blood was on fire at the sight of the burning station, and at the thought of the women in the hands of those scoundrels.""  A minute later, a man rode up at full speed from behind.  ""Is that you, Jones?"" Reuben said, stepping forward.  ""Yes, sir,"" the man replied, reining in his horse. ""I left Wilkins behind, and rode on to tell you what had happened.""  ""What has happened, Jones?""  ""It's a bad business, sir, a shocking bad business; but it might have been worse. It seems they broke in about half an hour before we got there. One of the hands was supposed to be on watch in the stockyard; but either he was asleep, or they crept up to him and killed him before he could give the alarm. Then they got up to the house and burst in the door, before the others were fairly awake.  ""They shot the two hands at once; but I suppose, as their blood wasn't up, and no resistance was offered, they thought they had plenty of time for fooling; for they must have reckoned that no force they need be afraid of could be got together, for three or four hours. So they made Donald and his wife and sister get breakfast for them. The women, it seemed had got pistols, and both swore they would blow out their brains if any man laid a hand on them. However, the bush rangers did not touch them, though they told them they would have to go off with them.  ""They made Donald sit down at one end of the table, while their captain took the other; and the two women, half dressed as they were, waited on them. It was lucky for them that we were so close when the alarm was given, for all made a rush to get to their horses; only the captain stopping a moment, to let fly at Donald.""  ""Did he kill him?"" Reuben asked.  ""No, sir, the bullet hit him in the body, and the ladies were crying over him when I went in, thinking he was dead. I thought so, too, but I found he was breathing. They poured some brandy down his throat, and presently he opened his eyes; then, as there was nothing for me to do, I thought I had best gallop on and give you the news, for I knew that you would be anxious to know what had taken place.""  ""Thank you, Jones, you did quite right. What an escape those poor ladies have had! Another quarter of an hour, we might have been too late, for those villains would not have kept up the farce long.""  ""No, sir, especially as they were drinking wine. The table was all covered with bottles.""  ""You did not see anything of Jim, did you?"" Reuben inquired.  ""No, sir, I did not see or hear anyone stirring about the place.""  Reuben gave a loud cooey.  ""That will bring him, if he is anywhere within hearing.""  But no answering call came back.  ""I hope nothing has happened to the poor fellow,"" Reuben said, after a pause.  ""He could not possibly be here by this time,"" Mr. Barker said. ""The place where he warned the shepherd must be sixty miles from here.""  ""Yes, quite that; but he can run nearly as fast as a horse can go, and he would be ten miles nearer here, in a straight line, than the way the man went round to fetch me.""  As soon as it became light they followed the track, which was plainly visible; but when they had gone half a mile further, there was a general cry of dismay--the ground was trampled in every direction.  ""Confound it,"" Mr. Barker said, ""they have done us! Do you see, they have ridden right into the middle of a large herd of cattle, and have driven them off in every direction; and have, no doubt, themselves scattered among the cattle. They may go like that for three or four miles, and then draw off from the cattle at any spot where the ground is hard, and no tracks will be left; to meet again at some appointed place, maybe fifty miles away.""  ""Then you don't think it's any use in pursuing them?"" Reuben asked, in a tone of deep disappointment.  ""Not a bit in the world,"" Mr. Barker replied decisively. ""If we had a native tracker with us, he might possibly follow one horse's track among those of all the cattle, discover where he separates from them, and take up his trail; but I doubt, even then, if he would be successful. These fellows know that a strong party is in pursuit of them, and each of them will do everything they can to throw us off the scent. They are sure not to go straight to their place of meeting, but each will take circuitous routes, and will make for thick bush, where it will be next to impossible for even a native to follow them. No, they have done us, this time.""  ""Well, gentlemen, I hope you will all wait as long as you can at the station here. If my boy has not been shot by those scoundrels, he is sure to find his way here; and will be able, in all probability, to set us on the right track.  ""At any rate, though the bush rangers have given us the slip, we may congratulate ourselves on our morning's work. We have at least saved those poor ladies.""  So saying, Reuben turned and, with the party, rode slowly back to the station. On arriving there, they dismounted and unsaddled their horses, and turned them into a paddock close to the house, to feed. Reuben and Mr. Barker then went up to the house. The constable who had been left behind came out.  ""Well, Wilkins, how is Mr. Donald, and how are the ladies?""  ""He is sensible now, sir; but I don't think there's much chance for him.""  ""We ought to get a surgeon, at once,"" Reuben said. ""Who is the nearest, Mr. Barker?""  ""The nearest is Ruskin.""  ""Is there no one nearer than that?"" Reuben asked. ""Why, he lives about halfway between where I was sleeping last night, and my own place. It must be seventy miles away.""  ""He's the nearest,"" Mr. Barker said; ""take my word for it.""  ""I'll tell you what will be the best plan,"" Reuben's host of the night before said. ""I will ride at once to Mr. Barker's and, if he will let me get a fresh horse there, I will gallop straight back to my place, and will send a man off the moment I arrive there to fetch Ruskin.  ""It is only eight o'clock now. I can be home before noon, and my man will do the next stage in a little over four hours. If he finds Ruskin in, he can get to my place by ten o'clock at night, and can start again at daybreak; so by eleven o'clock tomorrow he can be here. If he isn't here by that time, it will be because he was out when my man got there. At any rate, he is sure to start directly he gets the message.""  ""That will be the best plan,"" Reuben agreed; ""and I am sure the ladies will be greatly obliged to you, when I tell them what you have undertaken.""  ""Oh, that's nothing,"" the settler said. ""We don't think much of a seventy miles' ride, here.""  Without any further delay, the settler saddled his horse and went off at a gallop towards Mr. Barker's, where he was to get a fresh mount.  ""And now, how are the ladies, Wilkins?""  ""They are keeping up bravely, sir. I think, as far as they are concerned, Donald's being hit has done them good. It has given them something to do, and they have not had time to think about what they have gone through, and what a narrow escape they have had.""  ""Which room are they in, Wilkins?""  ""In there to the left, sir.""  ""As you have seen them, Wilkins, you had better go in and tell them that we have sent off, at once, to fetch a surgeon; and that they may rely upon his being here some time tomorrow, we hope before noon. Ask if there is anything that we can do for them, or for Mr. Donald.""  The policeman went in, and Reuben called one of his other men.  ""Perkins, do you, Jones, and Rider go in and fetch out the bodies of the men who have been killed. Don't make more noise than you can help about it. Carry them out to that shed there, and then get a bucket and wash down the floors, wherever there are bloodstains about. I want to have the place straight, so that those poor ladies may avoid seeing anything to recall the scene they have passed through. Of course, you won't go into the room where they are now.""  Three or four of the settlers at once volunteered to set to work to dig a grave.  ""Choose a place a bit away from the house,"" one of them said. ""The farther, the better; it will remind them of this affair, whenever they see it.""  While Reuben was arranging this point, the constable had come out and told Mr. Barker the ladies would be glad to see him.  ""It's a terrible business,"" the settler said to Reuben, as he turned to go into the house. ""I feel downright afraid of facing them. To think how bright and pretty they looked, when I rode over here ten days ago; and now there they are, broken hearted.""  He returned in a few minutes.  ""How is Donald?"" was the general question.  ""He is hard hit,"" the settler said, ""just under the ribs on the right-hand side. I expect the fellow aimed at his head, but he was starting from his seat at the moment. He isn't in much pain. I have told them they must keep him perfectly quiet, and not let him move till the surgeon comes.  ""They have asked me to see about everything. It's better we should not be going in and out of the house, as he must be kept perfectly quiet; so I think we had better establish ourselves under that big tree over there. There are some sheep half a mile over that rise, if two of you will go over, kill one and fetch it in. If you will light a fire under that tree, I will hand out from the house flour, tea, sugar, and some cooking things.""  There was a general murmur of approval, for all felt silent and awed at being so close to the house of death and sorrow. Two men got their horses, and rode off to fetch the sheep. The others carried the various articles requisite up to the place fixed for the bivouac, while Wilkins was installed in the house, to assist in anything that might be required there.  ""The poor things told me to tell you, captain, how grateful they felt to you for the exertions you have made. I told them how it was we came to be here; and how you had ridden, when you got the news, to be here in time. Mrs. Donald did not say much, poor thing, she seemed half dazed; but her sister, who seems wonderfully cool and collected, quite realized what they had escaped; and there's many a young fellow who would give a good deal, to win that look of gratitude she gave me when she said:  ""'I shall never forget what I owe you all.'  ""I am just going to send off one of my men, to fetch my wife over here. It will be a comfort to the two girls, for they are little more, to have a woman with them.""  ""There's nothing to be done for Donald, I suppose?"" Reuben asked.  ""Nothing. The wound is hardly bleeding at all. I told them that, as far as I knew, the best thing was to keep on it a flannel dipped in warm water, and wrung out; and that they should give him a little broth, or weak brandy and water, whenever he seemed faint. My surgery does not go beyond that. If it had been a smashed finger, or a cut with an axe, or even a broken limb, I might have been some good; for I have seen plenty of accidents of all kinds, since I came out twenty years ago, but a bullet wound in the body is beyond me, altogether.""  After the meal was cooked and eaten, there was a consultation as to what had best be done next. Two or three of the settlers who were married men said that they would go home, as their wives would be anxious about them. The rest agreed to stop for, at any rate, another day.  Mr. Barker had found out from Mrs. Donald's sister the direction in which the sheep and cattle were grazing, and two or three of the party rode off to tell the shepherds and herdsmen--for there were three men on the farm, in addition to those who had been killed--what had happened; and to tell them that they had better bring the sheep and cattle up to within a mile or so of the house, and come in themselves for their stores, when required.  A grave was now dug, and the three men buried. In the afternoon Mrs. Barker arrived, and at once took charge of the affairs of the house. In the evening Mr. Barker came up to the fire round which the men were sitting.  ""Will you come down to the house, Captain Whitney? The ladies have expressed a wish to see you. They want to thank you for what you have done.""  ""There is nothing to thank about,"" Reuben said. ""I only did my duty as a police officer, and am disgusted at those scoundrels having got away. I have done all I could, since I arrived; but I can't help feeling, being in command of the force here, that we are to some extent to blame for these fellows carrying on, as they have done for months, without being caught.""  ""I think you had better come down, Whitney,"" Mr. Barker said. ""There is something bright and hopeful about you, and I think that a talk with you might cheer the poor things up a bit. When people are in the state they are, they seem to turn to everyone for a gleam of hope, and comfort.""  ""Oh, if you think I can do any good, of course I will go; though I would rather stop here, by a good way.""  So saying, Reuben went down with Mr. Barker to the house. A lady met them at the door.  ""Arthur has just dozed off,"" she whispered. ""Mrs. Barker is sitting by him. She insisted on our coming out. Will you come in here?""  As silently as possible, the two men followed her into the kitchen, and closed the door after them. The fire was blazing brightly, Wilkins having piled on some fresh logs before going out to smoke a pipe. Mrs. Donald was sitting in a dejected attitude, by its right, when her sister entered with Mr. Barker and Reuben. She rose and, coming towards Reuben, said:  ""How can we thank you, sir, for the exertions you have made, and for having saved us from I dare not think what fate? As long as we live, my sister and I will bless you.""  ""I can assure you, Mrs. Donald,"" Reuben said, ""that I have done nothing but my duty, and I only regret that we did not arrive half an hour earlier.""  ""Ah, if you had!"" Mrs. Donald said. ""But there--we must not repine--even in my sorrow, I feel how much we have to be thankful for.""  ""Yes, indeed,"" her sister said, ""we have truly reason to be grateful.""  As she spoke, Reuben looked at her more and more intently. He had started when she first spoke, outside the house.  ""Good heavens!"" he exclaimed, ""is it possible, or am I dreaming? Surely you are Miss Kate Ellison?""  ""Certainly I am,"" she said in surprise, at his tone; ""but I don't think--I don't remember--why, surely it is not Reuben Whitney?""    Chapter 15: At Donald's.   It is difficult to say whether Kate Ellison, or Reuben Whitney was the most surprised at this unexpected meeting. The former, indeed, was aware that Reuben had come out to Australia; but that the boy, whose cause she had championed, should now stand before her as the officer, to whose energy and activity she and her sister owed so much, seemed almost incredible.  But the surprise of Reuben was at least equal to that which she felt. He could scarcely credit the evidence of his senses, at seeing before him the young lady whom he had believed to be thousands of miles away, in England. As is usual in these cases, the girl was the first to recover from her surprise.  ""And it is to you we owe so much!"" she said, holding out her hand. ""Mr. Barker spoke of our preserver as Captain Whitney; but somehow it never, for a moment, occurred to me to connect the name with you.  ""Is it not extraordinary, Alice?"" she said, turning to her sister.  ""The surprise to me is even greater than to you, Miss Ellison,"" Reuben said. ""Mr. Barker always spoke of Mrs. Donald and her sister, and I had not the least idea that you were in the colony. My mother wrote to me, a year ago, telling me of the changes which have taken place; but although she said that you had left Tipping, she said nothing about your coming out here.""  Reuben had, in fact, been much disturbed in his mind, a year previously, by hearing from his mother that Mr. Ellison had died suddenly. He had, it seemed, lost a large sum of money, from the failure of a bank in which he was a shareholder, and the blow had killed him. The estate was, when Mrs. Whitney wrote, for sale.  Reuben had written back, begging his mother to send him all particulars that she could gather; but communication between Australia and England was in those days very slow, and no answer had yet been received. Another letter had, indeed, told him that the estate had been sold. Mrs. Ellison, he knew, had died a few weeks after he had left England.  ""It is very simple,"" Kate Ellison said quietly; ""although of course it seems so strange to you, our being here. My sister was engaged to Mr. Donald before papa's death and, as you know, almost everything went owing to that bank; and as I had no reason for staying in England, I came out here with them.""  Reuben subsequently learned that Mr. Ellison had disapproved of the engagement of his daughter with Mr. Donald, who was the younger son of a neighbouring squire. When, after his death, Mr. Ellison's affairs were wound up, it was found that there remained only the six thousand pounds, which his wife had brought him, to be divided between her daughters. Mr. Donald possessed no capital, and had no prospects at home. He and Alice were quietly married, three months after her father's death, and had sailed a week later for New South Wales; where, as land could be taken up at a nominal price, it was thought that her little fortune would be ample to start them comfortably. All this, however, Reuben did not learn until some time later.  After chatting for a short time, he returned to the camp fire.  ""This is very awkward, Mr. Barker,"" Mrs. Donald said; ""do you know that Captain Whitney was, at one time, gardener's boy to our father?""  ""Oh, Alice!"" her sister exclaimed, ""what difference can that make?""  ""It seems to me,"" Mrs. Donald said, ""that it makes a very great difference. You know mamma never thought well of him, and it is very awkward, now, finding him here in such a position; especially as he has laid us under an obligation to him.  ""Do you not think so, Mr. Barker?""  ""I do not pretend to know anything about such matters, Mrs. Donald,"" Mr. Barker said bluntly; ""and I shouldn't have thought it could have made any difference to you, what the man was who had saved you from such a fate as would have befallen you, had it not been for his energy. I can only say that Captain Whitney is a gentleman with whom anyone here, or in the old country, would be glad to associate. I may say that when he came here, three or four months ago, my friend Mr. Hudson--one of the leading men in the colony--wrote to me, saying that Captain Whitney was one of his most intimate friends, that he was in every respect a good fellow, and that he himself was under a lifelong obligation to him; for he had, at the risk of his life, when on the way out, saved that of his daughter when she was attacked by a mad Malay at the Cape.  ""More than that, I did not inquire. It was nothing to me whether he was born a prince, or a peasant.""  Mrs. Donald coloured hotly, at the implied reproof of Mr. Barker's words. She had always shared her mother's prejudices against Reuben Whitney, and she had not been long enough, in the colony, to become accustomed to the changes of position which are there so frequent.  ""You do not understand, Mr. Barker,"" she said pettishly. ""It was not only that he was a boy employed in the family. There were other circumstances--""  ""Oh, Alice!"" Kate broke out, ""how can you speak of such things? Here are we at present, owing more than our lives to this man, and you are going now to damage him by raking up that miserable old story.  ""Mr. Barker,"" she said impulsively, ""my father, one of the most just, as well as one of the most kind of men, had the highest opinion of Reuben Whitney; believe me, there was nothing in the circumstances to which Alice alludes which could cast the slightest slur upon his character.""  ""I feel certain of that, my dear young lady,"" Mr. Barker said, ""even without your assurance. Your sister is shaken by the events of the day, and no wonder; and I am quite sure that when she thinks this matter over she will see that, whatever her preconceived ideas may be, it would be most ungrateful and ungenerous to breathe a single word in disparagement of Captain Whitney.""  So saying, he turned on his heel and left the room; and Kate, wishing to avoid further words on the matter with her sister, followed his example.  Mrs. Donald's reflections were not pleasant. She felt that Mr. Barker's reproof was well deserved, and that she had acted ungratefully and ungenerously. As a rule, Mr. Ellison's elder daughter was by no means of an unkind disposition; but she was essentially her mother's child.  The question of Reuben Whitney had been one which had caused more serious dissension, between her father and mother, than any she ever remembered. She had taken her mother's view of the case, while Kate had agreed with her father; and although the subject had been dropped, by mutual consent, it had been a very sore one; and at the sight of Reuben, the remembrance of the old unpleasantness had caused her to play a part which she could not but feel was mean and unworthy. She felt angry at herself--angry with Mr. Barker, with her sister, and with Reuben.  She was standing there, with her lips pressed together as she thought over the matter, when Mrs. Barker came into the room.  ""He is awake now, my dear. Perhaps you had better go in to him.""  Then she dismissed from her mind the events of the last few minutes, and went in to take her place by the side of her husband. But as, during the long hours of the night, she sat there and thought over what had passed since the preceding evening, the thought of how much she owed to Reuben Whitney was uppermost in her mind; and when in the morning Mrs. Barker relieved her, she went into the other room, where Mr. Barker and Kate were about to sit down to breakfast, and said:  ""Mr. Barker, I thank you for what you said to me last night. You were right and I was wrong. I was ungrateful, and ungenerous. I can only say that it was a very sore subject, and that in my surprise I thought of the past, and not the present. Believe me, I am very sorry for what I said.""  ""That is quite enough, Mrs. Donald,"" Mr. Barker said heartily. ""I am very glad you have said what you have. I was sure that you would, upon reflection, feel that whatever the old grievance might have been, it could not weigh an instant against what you owe to that young fellow now. Let us say no more on the subject. You were shaken and not yourself, and I was wrong in taking you up so sharply, under the circumstances.""  Kate said nothing, but her face showed that she was greatly pleased at her sister's change of tone.  ""What is going to be done, Mr. Barker?"" Mrs. Donald asked. ""Of course, the friends who came to our rescue cannot stay here; and there is no chance of my husband being moved, for a long time.""  ""I am afraid not, indeed,"" Mr. Barker said. ""Most of them will leave this afternoon, in time to get back to their stations tonight.  ""I have been speaking with Captain Whitney, and he says that he with his men will certainly stay here, for the present. He sent off a messenger, last night, for six more of his men to join him here; for he still hopes to get news from his native boy, which may set him on the tracks of the bush rangers. You need, however, be under no alarm; for I think there is no chance, whatever, of the bush rangers returning.  ""By the way, Whitney would like to speak to you, after breakfast. He wants you to give him as minute a description as you can of the fellows you saw. We have already descriptions of four or five of them, given by men whom they have stuck up; but the band must have increased lately, and any particulars might be useful.""  Reuben came round in a quarter of an hour later. Mr. Barker fetched him into the room where Mrs. Barker and Kate were sitting.  ""Mr. Donald is no worse, I am glad to hear,"" he said, as he shook hands with the two ladies.  ""I see no change whatever,"" Mrs. Barker said. ""He is conscious, but does not speak much. He asked me, this morning, to tell you and all your friends how deeply he feels indebted to you.""  ""His thanks are due to the settlers, rather than to me, Mrs. Barker. They were volunteers, you know, while I was simply on duty. We had, however, one common interest--to get here in time to save the station and, above all, to catch and break up this gang of scoundrels.  ""And now, Miss Ellison, if you feel equal to it, would you kindly give us an account of what happened? Mr. Barker said that he would not ask you, yesterday; but something, perhaps, let drop by chance, might serve as an indication to us as to the direction in which these fellows have gone.""  ""I will tell you, certainly,"" the girl said, her face paling a little; ""although it is dreadful, even now, to think of. We of course had no idea of attack, and had gone to bed as usual. One of the men was always on guard, on the outside of the house; for these attacks made Mr. Donald nervous for the safety of my sister, and myself. Simpson was on guard that night. Whether he went to sleep or not, I cannot say.""  ""He did, Miss Ellison,"" Reuben interrupted. ""We found his body round by the end of the house. He had evidently been sitting down on a log, against the house; and had been killed by a crushing blow with some heavy instrument, probably one of the tools they used for breaking in.""  ""The first we knew about it,"" Kate went on, ""was a tremendous crash downstairs, which was followed by a continuous thundering noise. I think they must have burst the door in with crowbars, or something--that was the first noise we heard--but a strong wooden bar, inside, kept the door in its place till they battered it down with a log.  ""I hurried on some things. Just as I had done--it was not a minute, I think, from the time I woke--Alice ran in, partly dressed, too. I had heard Mr. Donald shout to the men, then there was another great crash as the bar gave way, and then some shots were fired.  ""Mr. Donald had been standing just behind the door, and had fired through it the moment before it gave way. He had not time to step back, and was knocked down by the door. It was fortunate for him, for the bush rangers rushed in and shot down the two men, instantly.  ""Alice would have run down to see what had happened to her husband, but I would not let her out of my room. She could have done no good, and might have been shot. Then we heard them moving about the house, swearing and using all sorts of horrible language. Then they shouted up to us to come down, or else they would come and fetch us; so we opened the door, and came down at once.  ""Alice gave a little cry of joy, as she entered the room and saw her husband standing unhurt, though still looking dazed and confused from his blow.  ""The leader of the band--I suppose you have not seen him, Captain Whitney?""  ""No, indeed,"" Reuben said. ""I would give a good deal to catch sight of him.""  ""What do you know about him?""  ""I only know that he is a young fellow, not much older than I am myself. His was a life sentence. He was concerned in a burglary in the country, in which two old ladies were killed. Two of his accomplices were hung for it, but in consideration of his youth, and as it was not proved that he took an absolute part in the murder, he got off with a life sentence. I heard about the case from Captain Wilson.  ""He came out here about a year after I did. He had not been here a month when he killed one of the guard, and made his escape. Since that time he has been a scourge to the colony. Not a week has passed without complaints of his bailing up and robbing teamsters on their way down to Sydney. He soon gathered two or three others about him, and his daring and impudence soon made him a noted character. Several times he, with two other men, rode into good-sized villages and, pistol in hand, went from house to house, and carried off every shilling in the place. He has ridden into large stores single handed, and compelled the storekeepers to hand over the contents of their tills. Sometimes they bring spare horses with them, and ride off laden with groceries and stores. He has committed at least a score of murders, always using his pistol at the slightest show of opposition; and sometimes murdering, apparently, from pure love of the thing.""  ""Do you know his name?"" Kate asked.  ""His real name? No, I don't know that I ever heard it. He is always spoken of as Fothergill.""  ""I will tell you his real name, presently,"" Kate said. ""As my sister and I came into the kitchen, he took off his hat and made a deep bow and said:  ""'Ladies, me and my mates are sorry to put you to any inconvenience; but as we happen to be hungry, we must trouble you to get us some supper. You need not bother to make tea, wine is good enough for us.'  ""Of course, as we were in their hands there was nothing to do but to obey his orders; so we spread the cloth, and brought out what there was in the larder. Then we fetched in the wine, and I brought several bottles of spirits; for, as I whispered to Alice, 'If they get drunk, we may be able to get away from them.'  ""Before they sat down, the captain told two of his men to go upstairs with us and fetch down our watches and jewelry, and the money there was in the house. Mr. Donald had already told them where they would find that.  ""We lit four candles, and put them on the table. The captain ordered Mr. Donald to sit down facing him, saying with a sort of mock politeness that they should not really enjoy their food, unless their host took the head of the table. Several times, while they were eating, I saw the captain looking hard at Alice and me. Presently he said:  ""'I have it now. Why, you are the Ellison girls, ain't you?'  ""I was astonished, as you may suppose, but I said:  ""'I am Miss Ellison, and Mrs. Donald is my sister.'  ""'By Jove, who would have thought it!' he said. 'Do you know who I am?'  ""I said I didn't, although really I seemed to have some sort of recollection of his face.  ""'Why,' he said, 'don't you remember Tom Thorne, whose father the squire turned out of the public house? And to think, now, that the squire's daughters are waiting on me. This is a piece of luck.  ""'Well, my dears,' he went on, with a horrible grin, 'you need not tell me how you came here now, you will have plenty of time for that. We have made up our minds to take you both with us, for it's a horrible lonely life in the bush, without the pleasure of ladies' society. But I never dreamt that I was in for such a slice of luck as this.'  ""Mr. Donald jumped from his seat as the fellow spoke, but in a moment he levelled a pistol at him and shouted:  ""'Sit down or I fire.'  ""Alice rushed to her husband, and pushed him down into his seat.  ""'I had rather die than go with you,' I said to him quietly.  ""'Perhaps so, my dear,' he replied; 'but you see, you haven't got the choice.'  ""Then he went on taunting us about old times, and especially reminding me that I had got him a thrashing, over breaking the school house window. When I went out to get them some more wine, for they wouldn't touch the spirits, I got a knife and hid it in my dress; for I made up my mind to kill myself, rather than that.  ""A little later I stole upstairs and brought down a brace of pistols, which Mr. Donald kept under his pillow, and slipped one into Alice's hand. Presently they began to get noisy, and the captain ordered me to come and sit on his knee. Then Alice and I showed the pistols, and said we would shoot ourselves, if one of them laid a finger on us.  ""The captain muttered some order to his men, which I didn't hear; but I guessed it was to leave us alone, for the present. I had no doubt what they intended to do was to catch us off our guard, and wrench the pistols from us; and I was glad I had the knife hidden away, for if they did carry us off, I was sure to be able to find some opportunity for using that.  ""It was awful!"" the girl said, putting her hand to her face. ""Awful to be standing there and hearing them laughing and shouting and cursing. I was tempted to go behind him, and shoot him suddenly; but the others would have been just as bad, and we should have gained nothing by it. I would not go through that half hour again, for all the money in the world.  ""The men had just finished and were getting up from the table, and I knew the moment was coming fast, when we heard a sudden shout outside. My heart gave a bound, as they rushed to the door. The captain fired a shot at Mr. Donald, just as he was getting up; and as he ran out, shouted to me:  ""'I will come back for you, missy.'  ""If it had not been for Mr. Donald falling to the ground, I should have fainted; but Alice called me as she ran to him, and I think I was trying to lift him up when the constable ran in, and I knew we were saved.""  Reuben had given a sudden start, when Kate Ellison mentioned the name of Tom Thorne, but he had not interrupted her.  ""I had a score against that scoundrel before,"" he said, as she finished; ""and by heavens, I will settle accounts with him when I meet him. I could have forgiven him for the wrongs he did me; but now--"" and his fingers closed on the hilt of the pistol in his belt.  Kate, who had been looking down as she told her story, raised her eyes at the tone of intense passion in the young officer's words; and a sudden flush of colour mounted into her cheeks, which were pale from the terror and excitement through which she had gone.  ""I say ditto to Captain Whitney,"" Mr. Barker said. ""I don't know anything about his previous doings against him; but I know that, if ever I come across the scoundrel, I will shoot him as a dog.  ""Even you can't say anything against that, wife, though you are always on the side of mercy.""  ""No,"" Mrs. Barker agreed. ""I would say nothing to stay your hand there, John. Even putting this aside, he has committed a score of murders; and there will be no more wrong, in shooting him, than there would be in killing a wild beast.  ""That is the sound of a horse coming, at a gallop. Perhaps it is the doctor.""  Hurrying to the door they found, to their great satisfaction, that Mrs. Barker's guess was verified. The surgeon had been at home when the messenger arrived, and had started five minutes later, arriving three or four hours earlier than they had even ventured to hope.  Mrs. Barker at once led the way into the next room and, a few minutes later, came out again for hot water and sponges. Kate had stolen away upstairs, when the surgeon had entered the house. The two men remained to hear the verdict.  ""He is going to probe the wound. He can give no opinion, yet, till he discovers what course it has taken; but he says that it is a favourable symptom that the pulse is so strong and regular. He wishes you both to come in, as it will be necessary to hold his patient's hands, while he is making the examination.""  ""I cannot give any positive opinion,"" the surgeon said, when he had finished the examination. ""I can't find the ball, and I cannot tell for certain what course it took, after entering; but I think, judging from the pulse, and I may say from the expression of his face, that no vital part is injured.""  An exclamation of thankfulness broke from Mrs. Donald.  ""We must not be too sanguine,"" Mr. Ruskin went on; ""but there is certainly strong ground for hope. I shall be able to give a more definite opinion, in the course of a few hours. He must, of course, be kept perfectly quiet; with no more nourishment than is absolutely necessary, and that in the shape of beef tea. I should make him a bed here. We will manage to slide a door under him, and lift him on to it, with as little movement as possible.  ""At any rate, madam,"" he said, turning to Mrs. Donald, ""I can congratulate you upon the fact that the bullet did not strike a couple of inches higher. Had it done so, my ride would have been a useless one.""  A bed was at once brought from a room above and made up, and Mr. Donald was placed upon it, in the manner which Mr. Ruskin had suggested. Then with lightened hearts the party, with the exception of his wife, left the room.  Kate and Mrs. Barker at once set to to prepare a meal for the surgeon; while Reuben went over to give his companions the good news, that the surgeon had strong hopes that Mr. Donald would recover.  In the afternoon all the party, with the exception of Mr. and Mrs. Barker and the constables, rode off to their respective stations; assuring Reuben of their readiness to assemble again, at once, should he obtain news which would afford a hope that the gang could be traced.  A few hours later, the other four constables for whom Reuben had sent rode up. An outhouse was now prepared for the reception of the police, Reuben himself taking up his abode there, although Mrs. Donald strongly urged him to come into the house; but with Mr. and Mrs. Barker and the surgeon there, and the time of one of the ladies taken up with the wounded man, Reuben thought that their hands were perfectly full, and said that he should prefer to mess and sleep with his men.  ""You see, Mrs. Donald,"" he said, as she tried to induce him to alter his determination, ""I shall have to be sending out men and receiving reports, and may be obliged to ride out in the middle of the night; therefore, you see, as absolute quiet is ordered for your husband, it will be far better for me to be outside the house; as the coming and going would be sure to disturb him, and he would naturally want to know what is going on.""  ""You will not, I hope, take all your party away in pursuit of these men, Captain Whitney,"" she said anxiously. ""They might get up some false alarm, to take you away, and then come down upon the house again. I have been too much taken up with my husband to think much about it; but although Kate keeps up bravely, I know that she is greatly shaken, and terribly anxious. I don't know whether she told you; but it was to her, chiefly, that horrible man spoke; and it was she he told, as he rushed out, that he would come back to fetch her. She will never have a moment's peace, or tranquillity, till we hear that he is either killed or taken.""  ""Nor shall I,"" Reuben said. ""I do not think that the scoundrel will dare to attempt to carry out his threat to come back again; but with so daring a villain, it would be rash to omit the smallest precaution. You may be quite sure, Mrs. Donald, that in no case will I leave the house unprotected; and that if I should be called away I will leave two men here who, during my absence, will remain in the house; and with them, Mr. Barker, and the doctor, you may feel perfectly assured that no open attack will be made.  ""But I cannot impress too strongly upon you that, seeing the man with whom we have to deal, your sister should not stir outside the house; until we have caught him, or until Mr. Donald is so far recovered as to be able to be removed. I will not tell her so myself; because I see that, now the strain is over, she is greatly shaken, and I would not add to her anxiety; but if you could break it to her, as if it were your own idea, that she had better keep within doors until this fellow's caught, I am sure that it will be well.""  ""You will come in this evening, I hope; and always of an evening, Captain Whitney. It will make a change, and cheer us up; besides, we want to hear all about your adventures, since we saw you last.""  This Reuben gladly promised and, after it was dark, and he had placed a sentry, he came into the house. Mrs. Barker was on duty in the sick room; and Reuben, at Mrs. Donald's request, gave them an account of the voyage out, and of the circumstances which had led to his entering the police.  He would have passed very briefly over the affair at the Cape, but by many questions Mrs. Donald succeeded in eliciting from him all the details of the story.  ""It was a gallant action, indeed,"" she said warmly. ""You certainly saved the lives of those two girls, at a terrible risk of your own.""  ""To make the romance complete, Whitney,"" Mr. Barker remarked, ""you ought to have married Miss Hudson.""  ""Unfortunately, you see,"" Reuben said with a smile, ""in the first place I was only a boy, and she was two years my senior; in the next, and much more important place, she happened to be in love with someone else; and I did not happen to be in love with her, though she was, I admit, a very charming young lady, and had been extremely kind to me.""  ""How was that, Whitney?"" Mr. Barker asked. ""Eighteen is a susceptible age. I can only account for your coldness on the supposition that you had left your heart in England.""  ""I fancy my heart was, then, where it is now,"" Reuben rejoined, with a slight smile.  ""In the right place, eh, Whitney?""  ""In the right place,"" Reuben repeated quietly.  At this moment Mrs. Barker entered, and said that Mr. Donald would be glad if Reuben would come and sit with him, for a little time.  ""Don't let him talk much,"" Mr. Ruskin said. ""The less he talks, the better; but your talking to him, for a time, will cheer him up and do him good.""  ""I am glad to see you going on so well, Mr. Donald,"" Reuben said heartily, as he entered. ""The doctor says you are not to talk much; but you are to play the part of a listener.""  ""Do you think you will catch these fellows?"" was Mr. Donald's first question.  ""I will catch them, sooner or later,"" Reuben said. ""I will run them down if they are above ground; but I can take no steps in the matter until I hear from my black boy. I have been expecting him to turn up, ever since I got here; and shall begin to be afraid that those scoundrels have ill treated him, if he does not turn up before long.""  ""My wife has been telling me that they knew you at home, Whitney; and that she and her people did you some terrible injustice, somehow. But she wouldn't go into the matter. Curious, isn't it, your meeting at this end of the world; and that, too, at such a moment?""  ""It is curious,"" Reuben said; ""what people call a coincidence. But Mrs. Donald is mistaken in telling you that her people did me an injustice. Her father was one of the kindest friends I ever had, and although Mrs. Ellison somewhat misjudged me, and her daughter naturally shared her feeling, they were not in anyway to be blamed for that; for they only thought as ninety-nine people out of a hundred did.""  ""Whitney, Whitney,"" Mr. Donald muttered to himself. ""I seemed to know the name, though I cannot recall where.  ""Ah!"" he said suddenly, ""of course I remember now, for I was in the court when--"" and he stopped.  ""When I was tried,"" Reuben put in quietly. ""Yes, that was me. I was acquitted, as you know, principally from the way in which Mr. Ellison stood up for me. Thank God that he never, for an instant, believed that I was guilty.""  ""And to think it should be you!"" Mr. Donald said. ""How strange things turn out! I remember I could not make up my mind about it. It seemed so strange, either way.""  ""We had better not talk about it now,"" Reuben said quietly. ""I said then, and I say now, that I knew the people who did it and, strange as the circumstances have already been, you may think them stranger still, some day, if I bring one of them before you, alive or dead.""  At this moment there was a knock at the door, and Mrs. Donald came in and said that one of the constabulary wished to speak to Reuben.  ""Then I will say goodnight. I hope I shall find you getting on nicely, in the morning, Mr. Donald.  ""Will you say goodnight to Miss Ellison and Mrs. Barker for me, Mrs. Donald? And tell Mr. Barker that I shall be ready, in five minutes, to smoke that pipe we talked about with him, outside.""    Chapter 16: Jim's Report.   ""Jones, what is it?""  ""Your black has just come, sir. I would not let him come in; for the fact is, he ain't a figure to introduce among ladies.""  ""What's the matter with him, Jones? Not hurt, I hope?""  ""He has been knocked about a bit, sir; and he is done up with travelling. The poor fellow can hardly crawl, and was half starved; so I set him to work eating, and came off to fetch you.""  By this time they had arrived at the door of the shed. Jim was sitting by a fire, eagerly devouring a hunch of cold meat. The men were standing round, waiting till he had appeased his hunger before they asked any question. He looked up and nodded, when Reuben entered.  ""Well, Jim, I am glad to see you back,"" Reuben said heartily. ""I was beginning to be afraid about you. I hope you are not hurt?""--for the black had a handkerchief tied round his head.  Jim gave a grunt, but continued stuffing great lumps of meat into his mouth. Reuben saw that he must wait till the black's hunger was satisfied, and stood quietly looking on until, having devoured some five pounds of meat, he gave a sigh of contentment, and then took a long draught of rum and water, which Constable Jones handed to him.  ""Jim better now,"" he said.  ""That's right, Jim; now tell us all about it.""  Jim's story was a long one, and it took more than an hour in the telling; for his English was not always distinct, and it often required much questioning, on Reuben's part, before he could quite make out its meaning. The substance was as follows:  On leaving, some ten days before, on the mission of discovering the haunt of the bush rangers, he knew that it was of no use to go among the wild blacks, their allies; as the hostility against their semi-civilized fellows was so great that he would, at once, have been killed. He resolved to go back to the spot where the track had been obliterated, by that of the flock of sheep; to make a wide circuit, and pick it up beyond and, if possible, follow it until he found them. The difficulties were great, for the bush rangers had spared no pains in hiding their trail; keeping always upon hard, high ground, and at one time getting into the bed of a running stream, and following it for two miles before they again struck for their rendezvous.  However, step by step Jim had tracked them; sometimes losing the trail altogether, sometimes guided merely by a fresh-made scratch on the surface of a stone, or by a broken twig or bruised blade of grass. At last, he traced it far out into the bush, many miles beyond the furthest range of settlements, and then he lost it altogether. There had been a halt, for some time, at this spot.  Beyond this, Jim was entirely at fault. He made circle after circle round the spot, but could find no trace whatever of their passage, and returned to the point where he had missed the trail. He relit the embers of the fire which the bush rangers had made, cooked some food, and laid himself down--first to think it over, then to sleep, for it was now just the close of day.  It was clear to him that here, more than anywhere else, the bush rangers had made a great effort to throw anyone who might be pursuing them off the trail. He had no doubt that the bush rangers had muffled their horses' hoofs with cloth, and had proceeded with the greatest care through the bush, so as to avoid breaking a single twig in their passage; and the only reason for such greater caution could be that it was here, and here only, that they wished to throw the pursuers off the trail. It would have seemed, to a white man, that they had done this before, especially when they had kept in the water course; but to black Jim's perception, it appeared that they had been more careless than would be expected; and that, while apparently doing their utmost to conceal their tracks, they had really left sufficient indications to allow a practised tracker to follow them.  Why then, now that they were far beyond the settlements, and fairly in the country of their native allies, should they, for the first time, so hide their trail that he could not discover it?  The result of Jim's thoughts was that, when he awoke at daybreak, he started back towards the settlements. When he came to the river which the party had passed, in pursuit of the natives, he kept along its bank, scrutinizing the ground with the greatest care. After six miles' walking he suddenly stopped, at a point where the soft turf near the margin was cut up by the passage of the party of horsemen. Here was the confirmation of his ideas.  Arguing the matter out with himself, Jim had arrived at the conclusion that, hitherto, the trail had been a false one, the bush rangers' object being to lead their pursuers to believe that they had gone far out into the native country; whereas, in fact, their hiding place was somewhere among the settlements. Should this be so, the only way to find them was to search for their back track. This he had now found and, with a shout of triumph at his own cleverness, Jim forded the river and followed the track of the horses.  This was now clear enough, the horsemen taking no pains whatever to conceal their traces, feeling perfectly confident that any pursuers must now be thrown off the scent. Jim followed it till sundown, when he had made some thirty miles; and then, withdrawing some little distance from the tracks, he made his fire and camped for the night.  He was now inside the line of the outlying stations, and had approached to the edge of a bit of wild and broken country, which offered so few inducements to settlers that it had been passed by for the better land beyond; although occasionally, when herbage was scarce, the settlers in the neighbourhood drove the animals up to feed among its hills. The black had no doubt that the gang, of which he was in pursuit, had their haunt somewhere in the heart of this wild and little-known tract.  In the morning he again started and, after travelling several miles, entered a narrow valley with very steep sides, with trees and brushwood growing wherever they could get a foothold. He now adopted a careless and indifferent carriage and, although he kept a sharp lookout, no one who saw him would have supposed that he had any particular object in view.  Presently he noticed that the tracks turned sharply off from the line he had followed, in the centre of the valley; and entered the trees, which grew thickly here at the foot of the hills. He made no halt, even for an instant, but walked straight on. Half a mile further he sat down and lit his fire, and began to cook some food. He had no doubt that he was watched for, just after he passed the point where the track turned off, he heard a very low whistle among the trees.  As he sat by the fire, he kept his back towards the direction from which he had come; and when he presently heard footsteps, no change in his attitude betrayed that he was conscious of the fact that persons were approaching him, until two men stopped beside him. Then, with a cry as of sudden alarm, he leapt to his feet.  ""Lor' a mussy!"" he exclaimed, ""de white man frighten me bery much. What for dey no say dey come?""  ""Who are you, nigger, and where do you come from, and what are you doing here?""  ""My name Jim,"" he said; ""me going tro' the country looking for place to tend hosses. Me bery good at hosses. Me look arter de hosses ob Mr. Hudson.""  ""What did you leave him for?"" one of the men asked, sternly.  ""Someting lost from de house,"" Jim said quietly. ""Massa Hudson tink me took it. He make bobbery, so Jim ran away and look for nodder place.""  ""Um,"" the man said; ""I wonder whether you are speaking the truth? If I thought you weren't, I would put a bullet through your head, in double-quick time.""  ""No, sah,"" Jim said in great terror; ""dat de truth, sure 'nough. Jim try to get work at Sydney. Couldn't get; so start away, and ask at all de stations. No one want black boy for hosses, so keep on and tink dere more chance out furder. Does massa want a boy for hoss?""  ""What do you think, Bill?"" the man who had spoken asked his companion. ""Shall we put a bullet in this fellow's head, at once, or make him useful?""  ""I dussay he is a liar,"" the other replied; ""but then all these black fellows are liars, so that does not make much difference. A black fellow would certainly be useful for the horses, and to look after the fire. We can always shoot him when we have done with him. We shall soon see, by the way he handles the horses, whether he has been accustomed to them.""  ""All right,"" the other said. ""You come along with us then.""  ""What wages massa pay?"" Jim asked.  ""Anything you may be worth. Don't you fret about wages.""  Jim pretended to hold out for a fixed sum; but the man said, in stern tones:  ""Come along, we don't want no more jaw, so you had best hold your tongue.""  No other words passed till they got back to the trees, and then turned off where the horses had previously done so. Two minutes' walk brought them to a roughly-made shed, built against the almost perpendicular side of the hill. It was built of logs, and there was nothing to show that it was inhabited. No smoke curled up from the chimney. The door and shutters were closed. Anyone who, passing through the valley, had turned among the trees and accidentally come upon it, would have taken it for some hut erected by a wood cutter.  One of the men knocked three times at the door, and it was at once opened. Jim was pushed inside, the men followed him, and the door was shut.  ""Who have you got here?"" a man, sitting by the side of a large fire some distance inside the cottage, asked angrily.  ""It's a nigger who wants work. He says he is accustomed to horses so, as it was the choice between shooting him and bringing him here, we thought we might as well bring him to you. It would be handy to have a fellow to look after the horses, and cut the wood, and make himself useful. If we find he is of no use, there will be no great trouble in getting rid of him.""  ""That is true enough,"" the other said, ""and I don't think there's much risk about it.  ""Come here, you fellow, and let me look at you.""  Jim stepped forward towards the fire. He saw now that the hut was built against the entrance to a cave of considerable size. In the centre was a great fire, the smoke of which probably made its way to the surface through crevices in the rock above. Four other men, besides the one who had addressed him, were lying on sheepskins against the wall. There was an opening at the further end of the cave into an inner chamber; and here Jim knew, by an occasional snort or an impatient pawing, the horses were stabled.  The chief of the party asked a few more questions as to where Jim had come from, and how he chanced to be passing through so unfrequented a country. As the black had already decided upon his story, the questions were answered satisfactory enough.  ""I think he's all right,"" the man said, at last. ""At any rate here he is, and he's not likely to go out again. We have been talking of getting a black fellow, for some time; and as here is one ready to hand, we may as well make the best of him.  ""Look you here,"" he went on sternly, to the black; ""you come of your own free will, and here you have got to stop. You will have as much to eat as you can stuff, plenty of rum to drink, and 'bacca to smoke; and if there's anything else you fancy, no doubt you can have it. Only look you, if you put your foot outside that door, unless you are ordered to do so, I will put a bullet through your black brain.""  ""All right,"" Jim said. ""Plenty eat, plenty drink, plenty smoke; dat suit Jim bery well. He no want to go out of de house, if massa say no.""  ""That's settled then. Now, put some more logs on that fire.""  Jim at once assumed his new duty, and the bush rangers, who all hated the slightest work, were soon well satisfied with their new acquisition. There were several carcasses of sheep, hanging from hooks placed in the roof, where they were slowly smoked by the fumes from the wood. A pile of logs were heaped up in one corner, and these had to be cut up into sizes and lengths suitable for the fire. At one end a space was roughly partitioned off, and this was filled with groceries, flour, and cases of wine and spirits which had been taken from waggons going up country.  In the stable were several sacks of oats; and a barrel filled with water, which was drawn from a spring, a short distance from the hut. The first time Jim went into the stable the captain accompanied him, and soon saw, by the black's handling of the horses, that his account was so far accurate, and that he was thoroughly accustomed to stable work.  The cooking was also handed over to him, and the gang passed their time in sleeping, drinking, playing cards, and discussing plans of robbery. For the first few days a sharp watch was kept up on the black, and the men went out themselves to chop wood, or bring in water when it was required. After a few days, however, they relaxed their vigilance, and Jim gradually took these tasks also upon himself.  He was perfectly aware, although he pretended to be unconscious of it, that the first few times he went out one or other of the bush rangers stole quietly after him, and watched him at work; but as nothing suspicious was observed in his conduct, this supervision was gradually given up.  ""It's time to be moving again,"" the leader of the band said, about a week after Jim had joined them. ""We settled the next job should be Donald's station. We know for certain that he generally has money by him, and there will be the watches and trinkets of the women. That fellow Thompson, who worked for them at first, says he has got a first-rate cellar of wine; and that the women were both out-and-outers. If they are as pretty as he says, we will have them here, lads, to do the housekeeping. We want something to liven us up; besides, we shall forget our company manners, if we don't get some ladies to keep us up to the mark a little.""  There was a burst of coarse laughter.  ""What do you say, boys; shall we start tomorrow? It's a long ride, and we had best leave about noon. We must get into the neighbourhood before dark, so as to give the horses twelve hours' rest before we begin; for we may have to ride for it.  ""It ain't likely. Barker's is the nearest station, and it would be hours before they could get together men enough who would dare to follow us; but still, it's just as well to be prepared, and since that confounded new police officer has been on the station, there's never been no certainty about things. We owe him one for that last affair, which cost Smith, Wilson, and Mulready their lives; but we will pay him out yet. Who would have thought of his being there, just on that very night? I swear, if I ever catch him, I will roast him alive.""  ""He is no fool,"" one of the others said. ""He gave it those black fellows hot, and no mistake. The sooner he's put out of the way, the better. He's a different sort of chap than the last fellow. I sha'n't feel comfortable till he's got either a spear or a pistol bullet in him.""  [Illustration: Jim Notes the Bush Rangers' Plans for Mischief.]  Jim, who was squatting in the corner, apparently half asleep, was listening intently to every word. They did not heed his presence in the slightest; for indeed he had, since his arrival, so mixed his talk with native words that the bush rangers had no idea that he could follow their conversations.  He was thinking, now, what was his best course to adopt. In the first place, he had gathered from their talk that this was only one of their hiding places, and that they seldom stayed very long in one neighbourhood. The question, therefore, was whether they would return. It was of no use his going to give the alarm, unless he could return before his escape was suspected; or they would have made off before he could get back again.  As for the Donalds, whose station was to be attacked, it gave him no concern whatever; for the Australian blacks had little or no regard for life, except those of people to whom they were attached. It was Reuben's mission to capture the bush rangers and, had it been necessary, Jim would have remained quiet while a dozen families were slain, until he found an opportunity of bringing the police down upon them.  He listened now, intently, for any word which might afford an index to their intentions. Presently the question he hoped for came.  ""I suppose you will not come back here again, Tom?""  ""No, I thinks it's getting too hot to hold us, in these parts. We might ride back here, give our horses a rest, and load up with a few things we may want. We can bring two or three spare horses from Donald's. The weather is pleasant now, and we might very well put in a few weeks with the blacks. That last haul we made of traders' goods--cottons, and beads, and trumperies for the gins, and brass rings and such like for the men--will put them in the best of humours. You may be sure there will be a hot chase after us, after this business; and I should propose that we try our luck down south, for a bit.""  ""I agree with you,"" one of the others said. ""We have had a very good spell here, for the last ten months; and it don't do to tempt luck too long. That losing three of our number, last week, looked as if it was going to turn.""  ""What's it matter?"" the captain laughed. ""So much the more for us to divide. We have got a goodish bit of brass, now, to say nothing of the goods we have got at each of our places. We can fill up their places easy enough, any time; and those who come in are free to their share of what there is, in the way of grub and goods, but they only share in the brass from the time they join.""  Jim had heard what he wanted, and he now lay down and thought it out. They were only coming back for a short time. Possibly they might change their minds, and not return at all. It would be a risky thing to depend upon it; besides, his master might be blamed if this attack on the Donalds succeeded.  It would be better, then, to try to get word to him, in time for him to be there before the bush rangers arrived. He himself would return to the hut; so that, if the police arrived too late, he would be able to continue with the bush rangers till some fresh opportunity occurred for bringing his master upon them. It was possible, of course, that one of the men would be left in the hut, in which case he had only to wait.  The next morning the men busied themselves examining and cleaning their arms, and after dinner they went to the inner cave, and led out their horses.  ""Now, look here,"" the leader said to him, ""we are going away, you see.""  Jim nodded.  ""We come back again tomorrow. I lock this place up, you stop quiet till we come back. If anyone comes and knocks, while we away, don't Jim answer. Let them think place empty.""  ""All right,"" Jim said shortly, and went and sat down by the fire, as if he had no further interest in their proceedings.  The windows, he had already noticed, had not only shutters outside; but they were firmly closed within, with massive planks, securely nailed and fastened. Jim heard the last of the party go out, and then the door was shut, and the lock turned. Jim heard the party ride off, and then threw himself on the ground and listened, to assure himself that they kept steadily on their way.  The moment he was sure they were gone, he began to search the place for a tool which would fairly suit his purpose. Presently he found a large butcher's knife, with which they cut up the carcasses; and with this he set to work to dig a hole in the ground, close to the wall of the hut. The bottom log was only sunk a few inches in the soil, and in two hours he had burrowed under it, and made his way out beyond; then he crept back again, scraped the earth into the hole again as tightly as he could, crawling out backwards. He then placed a piece of turf over the outside hole, and stamped it down flat.  It was possible that, after he had started, they might change their mind and send one of their number back again; that, however, had to be risked, and at a steady run he set off for the settlements. He did not make for the nearest; for he had gathered, from the talk of the men, that the convict labourers of most of the settlements in the neighbourhood were in league with them.  After three hours' steady running, in which he had covered over twenty miles, he saw a shepherd's cottage and, making for it, gave the man the message which he had taken to Reuben. He had no sooner done so, and had found that the man was willing to set off with it at once, than he turned and retraced his steps to the hut, as rapidly as he had come. It was already dusk when he reached it.  Instead of approaching boldly, he made a circuit and crawled up to it on his belly; and lay for some time, listening intently, with his ear to the door. He felt convinced that no one was there; but to make sure he knocked, and then withdrew among the trees. But all was still and, feeling sure now that the place was untenanted, he removed the piece of turf from the hole and made his way back into the hut again; carefully replacing the piece of turf, and then packing earth under it, so that it would not give way if trodden upon. This, however, was a very unlikely occurrence, as he had made the opening where some bushes screened it from view.  He swept up every scrap of soil from the floor inside, filled up the hole there and trampled it down; and then, after indulging his appetite to the fullest, threw himself down and went to sleep.  When he awoke, a few streaks of light streaming through the cracks of the door showed that it was day; and he made up the fire, and awaited the return of the bush rangers.  It was four or five hours before they returned, and the instant they opened the door and entered, Jim was sure that they had failed; but to his disappointment all were there, and his plan of taking them in a trap had not succeeded. At this he was not surprised; for his own calculations, as to the distance to be traversed, had shown him that it was very questionable whether, even under the most favourable circumstances, Reuben could have got there in time with his men.  Without speaking a word to him, the men led their horses through to the inner cave, and then threw themselves down by the fire. Jim at once proceeded to unsaddle the horses, and rub them down; keeping an ear open, all the time, to what was being said by the bush rangers. Their remarks however were, for a time, confined to terrible curses as to their luck.  ""How did it come about, that's what I want to know?"" the leader said. ""This is the second time that accursed police fellow has turned up, and put a spoke in our wheel. Why, it was not more than half an hour after the first shot was fired before they was down upon us; there must have been pretty nigh twenty of them. How could they have got such a lot of men as that together, if they hadn't known that we were coming? It beats me altogether.""  ""So it does me!"" was the general exclamation.  ""They seemed regularly to jump out of the ground, just when all was going pleasant. Never knew such a bit of luck--that is, if it was luck, and not done o' purpose--and yet, I don't see as they could have known, possible, as we was going there. Why, we didn't know ourselves till yesterday, not what day it was to be; and except ourselves, and that black fellow, no one could have known it.""  ""Well, it's certain none of us blabbed; and I don't see as how he could have told anyone.""  ""Not exactly,"" the leader said, ""considering he's been shut up here, ever since we have been away; besides, I don't believe he knew anything about it. He don't make out half we say to him and, when we are talking together, he minds us no more than if he had been a black monkey; but if he did, it's no odds, he could not have passed through these walls and back again; and if he could, who was he to tell it to? The men round here are all our pals, and would have cut his jaw short with a bullet. But there, it's no use talking about it, he's not been out, and there's an end of it.  ""Still, it beats me altogether. That police fellow seems to know what we are up to, just as well as we do ourselves. I would give all my share of the swag we have made, for the last six months, for a shot at him.""  ""I don't like it,"" one of the others said, ""I don't; blest if I do; and I says as the sooner we are out of here, the better. After what's happened, I sha'n't feel safe till I am well out in the blacks' country. If he knows what we are going to do, there ain't any reasons why he shouldn't know where we are.""  ""Why, Johnson,"" his leader sneered, ""you don't really believe the fellow's a sort of conjurer, do you?""  ""I don't know,"" the man said doggedly. ""After he has turned up twice as he has, I shouldn't be surprised at nothing--not if I heard the sound of him and his men galloping up outside, now.""  There was a moment's silence, as each involuntarily listened.  ""We are getting to be like a pack of gals,"" the leader said savagely, ""and I agree with you, the sooner we are out of this, the better. As soon as it gets dark, we will be on the move; but I tell you, directly we get out among the blacks, I shall come back again. I am going to carry off that gal, somehow. I've owed her one for years and years, and I always pays my debts--at least, that sort of debt.  ""Now then, you black, just leave them horses for the present, and come and cook us some food; the quicker, the better.""  Jim hurried about, but in the bush rangers' present state of temper, nothing would satisfy them; and when, in his hurry to satisfy their angry orders, he stumbled and upset a glass of spirits and water he was handing to the captain, the latter caught up a brand from the fire; and struck him so violent a blow on the temple, with the glowing end, that he fell senseless on the ground.  He must have lain there a long time. He was brought to his senses by a bucket of water being dashed over him; and he found, when he staggered to his feet, that the band were preparing to depart. They had already packed up the bales of presents for the blacks, and placed them on the horses. Some of their more valuable belongings were packed away in a secret hiding place, the rest were left to take their chance till they returned; and indeed, except by their friends among the shepherds, there was little probability of anyone paying a visit to the hut, however long their absence might be.  Had it not been that Jim had proved himself a really useful fellow, for the last week, they would have shot him at once and tossed his body in the wood; but they found it so pleasant, having all their work taken off their hands, that after a short discussion they decided to take him with them.  The door was locked, and they started at a trot; but evening was closing in, their horses had already performed two long journeys in the last twenty-four hours, and they soon settled into a walk. They travelled for some hours and, it being then evident that the horses could proceed no further, a halt was called. No fire was lighted, for they were scarcely beyond the settlements and, for aught they could tell, an active search might still be carried on for them.  So anxious were they, that they agreed to keep watch by turns; but when morning broke, it was discovered that the black was missing. The next quarter of an hour was spent in angry recriminations; but as none could say in whose watch he made his escape, their quarrel ceased.  ""It's no use bothering about it,"" the leader said. ""There's one thing, he knows nothing, and can tell nothing against us. He may guess what he likes, but people don't waste time in listening to black fellows' stories. I expect he has only given us the slip because of that lick across the head I gave him, last night. I admit I was a fool to do it, but I wasn't in the best of tempers.  ""However, if the worst comes to the worst, he can only lead them to the hut; and they won't find much worth taking, there. When we once get out to the blacks, we can snap our fingers at them.""  It was, indeed, about midnight when Jim had stolen away. He was still faint and giddy, and his face was terribly burned by the blow which had been dealt him; but when once fairly away from the bush rangers, he set out in the direction in which he knew the Donalds' station lay; and never halted until he arrived there, on the following evening, utterly wearied and worn out, for he had eaten nothing on the previous day.  ""Then they have got away after all, Jim,"" Reuben said, when he had listened patiently to the long narration. ""You have done all that was possible, Jim. You have done splendidly, my poor fellow, and although we were just too late to catch the bush rangers, we saved the people here; but it is indeed unfortunate that they should have got off.""  ""Jim knows where dey hab gone,"" the black said. ""Dey hab gone to de country of Bobitu--I heard dem say de name. Jim know dat country well--he come from der.""  Further question showed that Jim had, indeed, belonged to Bobitu's tribe; and had come with a party of his people down to the settlements, where he was taken ill and left to die, but was picked up and nursed by Mr. Hudson.  ""And you could take us there?""  Jim nodded.  ""Bery long march, massa. Tree days, with horses. Plenty bad people; much fight.""  ""I don't care how far it is, or how much fighting we have got to do; I am bound to hunt down that fellow, however far he's gone. I suppose there is no trouble about water. If they can go there, we can.""  ""Four, six water holes,"" Jim said. ""No trouble about dat--trouble from de black fellow.""  ""Well, we must risk it, anyhow. We can't start for a day or two. I must send and fetch up all the police, and I daresay some of the colonists will join. The news of this business here has maddened everyone, and as it is not likely that the blacks will give any trouble for some time, and as we know the bush rangers have left for the present, no one need be afraid of leaving their station for a week or two.""  The next day mounted messengers were sent off in all directions, giving notice that the police would start, in three days' time, for a hunt after the bush rangers; and that there was, this time, every prospect of success, as their hiding place was known.  On the day named, no less than thirty settlers assembled; together with the whole of the police force. All were well armed, and had brought several days' provisions with them. Mr. Donald had made marked progress, and the surgeon had now every hopes of his recovery; but as he could not be moved, and it was just possible the bush ranger might return to carry out his threat, during their absence, two constables were left in the house; and Kate was charged, on no account, to put her foot outside the door.    Chapter 17: In Pursuit.   The last thing before the party started, Reuben went into the house. Mr. Barker was going to remain behind. He was past middle life, and the expedition was likely to be a very toilsome one; and Reuben was glad when he said that he thought six days' severe riding would be rather too much for him, and that he should constitute himself the guardian of the ladies.  ""My wife has arranged to stay here, while you are away; so I shall ride over to my place and see that all is going on straight, every day, and sleep here at night.""  ""Well, ladies,"" Reuben said, as he entered the room, ""we are just off. So I will say goodbye to you; and I hope that, on my return, I shall find Mr. Donald much better. I am sure that Mr. Ruskin would not have left, this morning, unless he felt that he had quite turned the corner. Pray take care of yourselves, while we are away. You know I don't want to alarm you, but pray be careful. I shall not feel comfortable, as to your safety, till I have that villain safely in my hands.""  ""Goodbye, Captain Whitney. You know you have all our best wishes,"" Mrs. Barker said. ""We will take care of ourselves, till we hear that you have destroyed the band; and above all, its leader.""  ""The news that you have done so,"" Mrs. Donald said, ""will do more, I think, for my husband, than anything in the way of doctoring. But take care of yourself, Captain Whitney. I know from what Mr. Barker said that, although you make light of your expedition, it is a dangerous one. He said the police had never ventured so far in the bush, and you may expect sharp fighting with the blacks.""  ""We may have a brush with them,"" Reuben said lightly; ""but do not be anxious about us. We are a very strong party, and you need have no fear of the result.  ""Goodbye, Miss Ellison; pray be careful till I return.""  The last words were said in an undertone, as he held her hand.  ""Goodbye, Captain Whitney,"" she said. ""God bless you all, and bring you safely back.""  Two minutes later, the party rode off. Jim was, like the rest, mounted, as they would travel fast. Four led horses carried provisions; for they would not, as before, find food by the way. It was two o'clock in the day when they started, and they rode thirty miles before they halted, for the night, at a water hole. They had seen no signs of natives during the day, but Reuben at once posted four men as sentries.  It was a merry party round the fire, for all were in high spirits at the prospect of an expedition to a point far beyond that to which any white men, with the exception of fugitives from justice, had penetrated; and they were delighted with the thought of putting a stop, at last, to the operations of the band who had so long been a scourge to the settlement.  Mr. Blount, Dick Caister, and several others who had formed part of the last expedition were of the party; and the confidence which these felt in their young leader, and in the sagacity of his native follower, communicated itself to those who had not formed part of the previous expedition.  ""Must start early,"" Jim said to Reuben, the last thing. ""Long way to water. Ride all day, not get dere before dark.""  They rode rapidly for some time, after starting, so as to allow the horses to take it easily, during the heat of the day, when there was a halt of three hours; but in the afternoon they quickened their pace again, and men and horses were jaded and done up when, just as the sun was setting, they arrived at their destination.  ""How that black fellow of yours finds his way through this bush is a perfect marvel to me,"" Dick Caister said. ""The country has become more undulating, this afternoon; but the first thirty miles were almost perfectly level, and I could see nothing, whatever, that could serve as an index, except of course the sun. Still, that is only a guide as to the general direction. It must have been nine or ten years since that fellow was here, and yet he led us as straight as if he was making for a church steeple.""  ""It seems to be a sort of instinct,"" Reuben said, ""although possibly, for the last part of the distance, he may have seen signs of the passage of the natives. As far as I can understand, he tells me at this time of year there is no other water hole, within a long distance; so that naturally there will be many natives making for it. I am glad there are not any of them here, now.  ""Why isn't that horse hobbled like the rest?"" Reuben asked suddenly. ""Whose is it?""  ""That is the one your black fellow rode, sir,"" Sergeant O'Connor said.  ""Jim, where are you?"" Reuben called, but no reply came.  ""What has become of him, I wonder?"" Reuben said. ""Has anyone seen him, since we rode up?""  ""He jumped off, the instant we came here,"" one of the policemen replied; ""and said to me, 'Look after captain horse,' and I haven't seen anything of him since.""  ""There has been somebody here, sir,"" another policeman said, coming up. ""Here's the remains of a fire, behind this bush.""  ""Yes,"" Mr. Blount said, examining them, and pulling out a brand that was still glowing. ""Do you see, a lot of sand has been thrown over it. Whoever was here must have seen us coming, and tried to extinguish the fire when they caught sight of us.""  ""That is most unfortunate,"" Reuben said. ""The fellows must have made off, to carry the news of our coming to their friends. However, it's too late to do anything now. It's already getting dark, and they must have got a quarter of an hour's start. We have taken quite enough out of the horses, and can do no more with them, if they have to travel tomorrow; but I would give a year's pay if this hadn't happened.  ""Well, there's nothing to do for it but to light our fires, and camp.""  The knowledge that they had been seen, and that the news would be carried to those of whom they were in search, acted as a great damper on the spirits of the party; and the camp was much more quiet and subdued than it had been, on the previous evening.  ""All is not quite lost,"" Reuben said when, two hours later, he found that Jim was still absent from the camp. ""I can only account for his stealing away from us, in that manner, by supposing that he must either have caught sight of the natives, or come upon their trail; and at once set off in pursuit. I don't see what it could be, otherwise.""  ""But if he saw them, why didn't he tell you, Whitney?"" Mr. Blount said. ""Tired as our horses were, they could have got up a gallop for a bit.""  ""Yes, but for a very short distance,"" Dick Caister put in; ""and as it was getting dusk, if the blacks had had anything like a start, we could not have overtaken them before it had got quite dark. Those blacks can run like the wind. It takes a well-mounted man to overtake them.""  An hour after the party had lain down, one of the sentries challenged; and the answer which came back, ""All right, me Jim,"" at once brought everyone to their feet.  ""Well, Jim, what is it? Where have you been?"" Reuben asked.  ""Jim hungry.""  ""That you may be quite sure,"" Dick Caister said, with a laugh. ""Was there ever a native who wasn't hungry; unless he had stuffed himself, half an hour before?""  ""Yes, I kept some supper for you, Jim,"" Reuben said; ""but before you begin to eat, just tell me if everything is all right.""  ""Everyting all right,"" Jim said, squatting himself beside the still glowing fire, and beginning to eat.  Reuben knew, by experience, that it was of no use questioning him until he had finished; and he therefore waited patiently, although one or two of the settlers grumbled at being kept waiting for the news. When Jim had finished his meal, he looked round. Reuben knew what he was expecting, and handed him a hornful of rum and water. The black took a draught; and then, without any further delay, began to tell his story.  He had, while still some distance from the halting place, seen a light smoke coming up, and was sure that a party was already there.  ""But why did you not tell us, Jim?"" Reuben interrupted. ""We might have galloped on, and caught them.""  ""No, sah, no catch dem; horses too tired, black fellow run away, when see white men coming. Dat no do at all. Only one way to do. Let 'em tink dat no one saw dem, else dey run and run, all de way to Bobitu.  ""When get near camp, Jim see dat smoke not come up, know de black fellow see white man and put out um fire. When Jim come here he jump off hoss, find fire, and follow de track. Dey four men; one go one way, one go anoder, two men go straight on. Dey go on to tell Bobitu, de oders go to black fellows in de bush. Jim not care for dem, follow de two.""  ""But how could you follow them, in the dark?""  ""Jim were sure de way dey go, dat enough for Jim. He suppose dat dey 'top after a bit; and when dey see de white men all 'top quiet at de water hole, and light fire, dey tink it all right. No make hurry, perhaps 'top and light a fire demselves.  ""So Jim go on quiet for two, tree hour; den at last he see fire, sure 'nough. He crawl up quiet and see two black fellow dar, and hear what 'em say. Dey tired, make long walk today to water hole; say no hurry, white men all go sleep round fire, not go on till sun get up, so dey stop for two, tree hour to rest demselves.  ""Jim get quite close and jump up, den cut off one black fellow head with sword, run sword through de body of other, finish 'em both, and den come back to camp.""  ""Well done, indeed, Jim!"" Reuben exclaimed, and a chorus of satisfaction rose from all the party at hearing that the men--who, had they reached the bush rangers, would have given the alarm, and so enabled them to make their escape before the expedition arrived--had been killed. The news, however, that two of the party had escaped, and might bring the blacks down upon them before morning, necessitated an increase of precautions.  Reuben at once divided the force into four parties, each consisting of five constables and seven settlers. One party were at once placed on watch, and were to be relieved in two hours' time.  ""I not tink dey come before morning, sah,"" Jim said. ""No water hole near here. Tomorrow plenty black fellow come.""  ""All right, Jim. We don't care for them, in the daylight; and now that I know the bush rangers won't be alarmed, I don't mind.""  Jim's prediction proved correct. The night passed off quietly, and the party again started at daylight. The country became more and more broken, as they proceeded. The undulations became hills. Some of these were so steep that all had to dismount, and lead their horses up.  ""Is Bobitu's camp among these hills, Jim?""  ""Ober toder side, sah. Him place in valley, toder side; bush, plenty game for black fellow.""  ""How far is it to this valley, Jim?""  Jim's ideas of figures were but vague, and he could only say that they would get there somewhere about sunset.  ""That would be a bad time to get there, Jim. We must halt, a mile or two this side of them; and you must lead half the party round, so as to cut off their retreat, even if we don't attack them till the morning. On their fresh horses, those fellows will gallop right away from us, if they once get a start.  ""There is no fear, I hope, of any of the other blacks getting there before us, and giving the alarm?""  Jim shook his head.  ""No. We come straight from water hole. Black fellow go round long way. No fear dey get dere. Dey fight when we go back.""  ""That's all right. Bobitu's fellows, and the bush rangers, will be quite enough to tackle at once. As for the others, we will make short work of them, if they venture to attack us on the march back. They fight pluckily enough against men on foot, because they know they can make off when they like; but they can't stand a charge of horsemen.""  Although not so long as the journey on the preceding day, the men were heartily glad when, at about four o'clock in the afternoon, the halt was called, and they heard that the place where the bush rangers were supposed to be was but four miles away. After some consultation, it was decided that Jim should lead half the band--consisting of ten constables under O'Connor, and fifteen colonists--round through the hills, to a position near the mouth of the valley in which the blacks and bush rangers were likely to be; and that, when he had posted them there, he should come back again to their present halting place, and lead forward the party under Reuben.  ""Mind,"" Reuben said, before the others started, ""we don't want to attack the blacks, unless they show fight. Our object is the bush rangers. Jim says that, by what he heard, they have got some sort of houses they have built there. Let us make straight for them. If the blacks attack, drive them off; but we can settle with them, afterwards. The great point is to capture or kill the bush rangers.""  All agreed to this, for although the blacks gave great trouble, by driving off the sheep and cattle, and sometimes killing the shepherds, there was not the same feeling of hatred entertained for them as for the bush rangers. It was felt to be natural that the natives should resent the occupation of their hunting grounds; and although they were shot down without mercy in fair fight, or if overtaken while carrying off cattle, there was no active feeling of animosity against them; and they were generally kindly treated, when they called unarmed at the stations, and asked for food.  Against the bush rangers, on the other hand, a deadly hatred was felt by the colonists; and the fact that these were constantly aided, by the ticket-of-leave labourers, increased the hostility with which they were regarded.  Jim left his horse behind him, when he started with his party; saying that coming back at night, in the dark, he would rather be without it. After their comrades had set out, those who remained behind posted two men as sentries; and then, as soon as they had cooked and eaten a meal, laid themselves down to sleep, until the time should come for their advance.  It was just midnight when Jim returned. He reported that he had seen no blacks by the way, and that he believed he had posted his party without their being observed. He himself, instead of returning by the same route that he had taken them, had come straight up the valley.  There were, he said, two huts which had been built by the bush rangers; and these were now occupied by them. There were great fires blazing, and he thought that the natives had probably only arrived there that evening. He had got near enough to find that they were in a high state of delight, at the presents which their white friends had brought them.  ""Did you catch sight of any of the bush rangers, Jim?"" Reuben asked.  ""Two ob dem came out and spoke to black fellows at fire, but too far off to see which dey were.""  An hour before daybreak the party moved forward, and halted within half a mile of the bush rangers' camp. There they stopped, till they could see the sunlight touch the top of the hill at the right-hand side of the valley. This was the signal agreed upon and, mounting, they rode forward at full speed.  Just as they got within sight of the huts, they heard a wild shouting, followed instantly by the crack of rifles. Another minute, and they had reached the scene and joined the other party, who had made straight to the huts. The blacks, awakened suddenly as they were sleeping round the embers of their fires, had hastily thrown a volley of spears, and had darted away among the bushes.  ""Surrender, in the queen's name!"" Reuben shouted, ""and I promise you that you shall be taken down, and have a fair trial.""  The answer came in the flash of a rifle, from the window of one of the huts; and a constable immediately behind Reuben fell dead, with the ball through his head.  ""Dismount!"" Reuben shouted, ""and break in the doors.""  With a shout, the men threw themselves from their horses and rushed at the doors of the huts.  ""Sergeant O'Connor,"" Reuben said; ""do you, with six of your men, keep up a fire at the windows. Don't let a man show himself there.  ""Let ten of the others look after the horses. We shall have the blacks back, in no time.""  So saying, he ran forward and joined those who were battering at the doors. Several of them had brought stout axes with them, and the doors speedily gave way. There was a rush forward.  Mr. Blount fell dead, and Dick Caister's shoulder was broken by a bullet; but there was no check, as the colonists poured into the huts. There was a short sharp fight, but in two minutes it was over. Three of the gang had been shot, as they leapt from the windows. Four more lay dead, or dying, in the huts.  One of them had thrown down his arms, and shouted for mercy. He had been knocked down and stunned, by the butt end of a rifle; but was otherwise unwounded.  Short as was the fight, it had given time to the blacks to rally. Their shouts were ringing in the air, and the spears were flying thickly as the party, having finished their work, rushed outside again, to assist the constables who were guarding the horses.  ""Pour a volley into the bushes,"" Reuben shouted; ""then mount, and charge them.""  The order was executed and, in a minute, the horsemen were dashing hither and thither among the bushes, shooting down with their pistols the blacks who resisted, or dealing tremendous blows among them with their hunting whips. The charge was irresistible, and in five minutes the main body of the blacks were flying, at full speed, up the steep hillsides.  The victors soon gathered round the huts. Several men and horses had been wounded with spears, but none of the injuries were of a serious character.  ""Well, how about the prisoners?"" Reuben asked the sergeant, who had arrived before him.  ""There's only one prisoner, sir. All the rest are accounted for.""  ""Is it their captain?""  ""I don't know, sir. I have never set eyes on him; but if he's a young chap, as they say, it ain't him.""  ""Jim,"" Reuben said, ""just go round and examine the bodies, and see which of them is the captain.""  Jim returned in a couple of minutes.  ""None of dem ain't him, sah. He not dere.""  Reuben started.  ""Are you quite sure, Jim?""  ""Quite sure, sah.""  ""Are you sure none of them escaped, sergeant?""  ""I am quite sure of that, sir. No one came out of either of the doors, and there were only three who tried to bolt through the windows, and we accounted for them all. Perhaps that chap who is prisoner can tell you where to find the captain. It's a bad job, indeed, if he has escaped.""  ""Is the man recovering his senses?""  ""Yes, sir, he's just coming round.""  Reuben stepped into the hut. The escape of Thorne destroyed all the satisfaction which his success would have given him. He had good reason to know the fiendish malignity of the man and, in spite of the warnings he had given Kate Ellison, and his strict orders to the police on guard, he felt a thrill of anxiety, now that he was aware her enemy was still at large.  The prisoner was sitting up, in a corner of the hut; a policeman, with drawn sword, standing near him.  ""Where is your leader?"" Reuben asked sternly. ""The man you call Fothergill.""  ""He went away yesterday morning,"" the man said, with a grin of satisfaction. ""You haven't caught him yet; and you will hear more of him, before you do.""  ""Where was he going?"" Reuben demanded.  ""You won't get nothing out of me,"" the fellow said. ""He's been a good mate, and a true, and I ain't going to put you bloodhounds on his scent. He's gone a-wooing, that's where he's gone, and that won't help you much.""  Reuben at once went outside, and called the settlers round him.  ""I am sorry to say,"" he said, ""that the leader of the party has got away. He rode off yesterday morning, and although the prisoner we have taken did not say where he has gone, I have not the least doubt he has ridden back to the Donalds, to try and carry out his threat to return for Miss Ellison.  ""Therefore, gentlemen, may I ask you to start homeward, at once. The horses have only done a few miles and, if we press forward, we may manage to get to our camp of the evening before last. We have no more to do here, except to see if there are any valuables hidden in the huts, and set fire to them.  ""I expect that we shall have fighting with the blacks, on our way back. Those parties the two fellows who got away went to fetch will, likely enough, bar our way. If it were not for that, I should ride on by myself; but my duty is to stop with my men until, at any rate, we have passed the place where the blacks are likely to attack us. That done, I shall push on. It is annoying, indeed, to think that that fellow must have passed us somewhere on the way, yesterday.""  The settlers agreed, at once. They all sympathized with Reuben, in his disappointment at the escape of the leader of the bush rangers; and regretted the matter deeply, on their own account. They were, too, now that the work was done, anxious to be off; not only because they wished to return to their stations, but because they felt that their position was a dangerous one. They had penetrated, to a distance hitherto unattempted, into the country of the natives; and they knew that these would gather round them, like hornets, on their return march.  Ten minutes were spent in the search of the huts. The police probed the ground with their swords, and closely examined the walls. They found, under some sheepskins in one corner, a bag containing upwards of two hundred pounds; which was doubtless the amount which the bush rangers had brought back with them, from their last plundering expedition, and had not yet been added to their main store, wherever that might be. This, however, was a welcome find to the police, and they abandoned the idea of searching further; and were about to set fire to the hut, when the prisoner said:  ""Lookee here! I may as well tell you where the lot is hidden. It may do me good, when it comes to the trial; and you may as well have it, as for it to lay there. You dig up the ground in front of that tree, behind the hut, and you will find it.""  Five minutes later a large leather bag, containing a considerable quantity of gold and notes, and a number of watches, chains, and other trinkets, was brought to light.  ""Don't stop to count the money now,"" Reuben said. ""Fasten it on one of the horses, and let us be off.  ""Sergeant, let Jones ride beside the prisoner, and be responsible for his safety. See that his hands are tied behind him, and his ankles tied securely to stirrup leathers. Let four men take charge of the eight horses of these bush rangers. Do you ride ahead with four others, and keep a sharp lookout as you go. Don't press the horses, but we must go at a smart pace, for we have a long day's march before us. It is fully sixty miles to the water hole where we camped, the night before last.""  A few minutes later, the party were in motion. Although disappointed at the escape of the leader of the band, they were well satisfied with the result of the expedition, and at the small amount of loss at which it had been accomplished. There was general regret at the death of Mr. Blount; but two lives were considered to be but a small loss, for the capture of so strong a body of bush rangers; who, knowing that they fought with ropes round their neck, always made a desperate resistance.  Half the journey was accomplished without incident, and Reuben felt satisfied that they would, at least, have no trouble with the tribe they had scattered in the morning. The speedy start that they had made had taken them beyond their pursuit; and if attacked, it would be by other tribes.  After an hour's halt, to feed the horses and cook some meat for themselves, the party proceeded again. Another fifteen miles were passed; then Reuben saw the sergeant, with the little party ahead, suddenly draw rein. He galloped forward to them.  ""What is it, sergeant?""  ""I am pretty sure I saw a black fellow's head, over that rock, sir. It's a nasty piece of ground. I noticed it yesterday, as I came along. It would be the worst place to be attacked in of any we have passed. If the blacks are here in force, they know what they are doing.""  Reuben examined the position. It was certainly a nasty place to be attacked in. The valley was narrow, and thickly strewn with boulders of all sizes, which had rolled down from the hillsides. Among these the bush grew thickly, and it was only down a narrow path in the centre, formed by a winter stream, now dry, that horsemen could pass.  ""I don't think it would do to make a bolt through that, sir,"" the sergeant said, shaking his head. ""We could only ride two abreast and, if they are strong, we should be riddled with spears before we got through; and there's no charging them, among those stones and bush.""  ""That is so, sergeant. We shall have to dismount, and drive them out foot by foot. There's nothing else for it.""  By this time all the party had come up, and Reuben explained to them the situation. All at once agreed that they could do nothing on horseback, on such ground.  The whole party therefore dismounted. The horses were tied to bushes, and the prisoner securely fastened to a tree. Then, rifle in hand, they moved forward.  The sergeant's eye had not deceived him for, as they approached the spot where the boulders and bush grew thickest, a shower of spears was thrown, and the native cry rose shrill in the air. The party were advancing in skirmishing order; and most of them threw themselves down, or dodged behind rocks, as the blacks rose to throw their spears and, a moment later, the rifles cracked out. Several of the blacks fell, and the rest disappeared among the bushes.  ""Make your way forward, steadily and carefully. Let each man watch his neighbour, to the right and left, and keep in line as much as you can.""  The fight now commenced in earnest, but the settlers and police gradually made their way forward. Not only had they the advantage in weapons; but the fact that they were able to fire while lying down, or stooping, gave them an immense advantage over the blacks; who had to expose themselves when rising to throw their spears, or take aim with their bows.  Several times, emboldened by their superior numbers, the blacks attempted a rush; but the heavy fire from rifle and pistol which greeted them, each time, sent them back in diminished numbers. At last the resistance became feebler, as the natives, seeing that they were being driven out of their shelter, began to slink off; so as not to be exposed to the fire of the white men, in the comparatively open ground beyond. Many, however, were not quick enough, and were shot down as they scaled the steep hillside.  The party of whites gathered, and compared notes. Many had received wounds more or less severe, but none of a nature to prevent them from continuing their journey. They quickly returned to their horses and, mounting, continued their way.  ""There is no fear of any farther attack, I should think, sergeant.""  ""I should think not, sir. The beggars must have had enough of it. They must have lost from forty to fifty men.""  Two hours later, the party arrived at the halting place.  ""Now, sergeant,"" Reuben said, ""I shall hand over the command to you; and shall ride on at once, with my boy. I am most anxious about the man who has escaped. I shall take four of the bush rangers' horses. They have not been ridden and, having had three or four days' rest, are comparatively fresh. The fellow has had only one day's start and, if I push straight on, I may be there before him.""  Reuben briefly bade adieu to his friends, while Jim was transferring the saddles to two of the bush rangers' horses and, leading two others, they started together in darkness. Changing saddles every ten miles, they rode on till past midnight, when they halted; for the horses, accustomed as they were to long journeys, were now completely broken down, and Jim and his master could scarce keep their seats.  ""Too much long,"" Jim said, as he threw himself down, after taking off the saddles and hobbling the horses; ""too much long, sah.""  ""It is long, Jim,"" Reuben replied. ""People in England would hardly believe horses could go a hundred miles in a day, even if led a part of the distance. Another fifty miles will take us to Donald's. It is about twenty miles to the water hole where we camped, the first night; and that was about thirty miles from the station.""  ""Shall Jim light a fire, sah?""  ""No, Jim, it isn't worth while. There is some cold meat in my haversack, if you are hungry; but I am too tired to eat. If there are any natives prowling about, a fire might bring them round on us.""  ""No tink black fellows near, massa.""  ""I don't think so either, but I don't want to run the risk, Jim; besides, I am sure neither of us can be trusted to keep watch.""  Reuben, in spite of his fatigue, was some time before he could get off to sleep. The thought that probably Tom Thorne was, at that time, camped at the water hole twenty miles ahead; and that, in the morning, his horse would be far fresher than those he had ridden, was maddening to him. At one time he thought of getting up, and pursuing his way on foot; but he was stiff in every limb, and felt that the journey was beyond him. Moreover, if the bush ranger had taken some other line, and was not camping there, he would have no means of pursuing his journey.  At the first gleam of daylight they were afoot. The saddles were put on the horses, and they continued their way. Reuben soon found, however, that the five hours he had rested had been insufficient to restore the horses and, even by riding them alternately, he could get them but little beyond a walk.  On arriving at the water hole, the remains of a fire were found. Jim examined the ground carefully, and found the tracks of a horse; and was of opinion that the rider had started three or four hours previously. Reuben carried a large flask of spirits and, having poured what remained in it down the throats of the horses, and given them a drink at the pool, he again pressed on.  Ten miles farther, he arrived at the first outlying station. The owner of this had not joined in the expedition, being a married man, and unwilling to leave his wife in such an exposed position. But upon Reuben's arrival he at once agreed to lend him two fresh horses, and to take care of those which Reuben brought with him.  While the settler was driving them in from the paddock, his wife busied herself in preparing two huge bowls of bread and milk. These were thankfully swallowed by Reuben and Jim and, five minutes later, they started on the fresh horses.  It was indeed a relief, to Reuben's anxiety, to find himself again flying over the ground at a rapid gallop, after the slow and tedious pace at which he had travelled since morning. His spirits rose, and the fears which had oppressed him seemed lifted, as if by magic. He assured himself that he had no cause for anxiety, for that the two constables would assuredly be on the watch, and Kate had promised not to venture beyond the doors of the house until his return.    Chapter 18: Settling Accounts.   Reuben soon checked the speed of his horse. Anxious as he was to arrive as soon as possible, he might, for aught he knew, yet have occasion to try the animal to the utmost; and he therefore reduced the almost racing pace, at which he had started, into an ordinary steady gallop. The horses were fresh and in good condition, and for several miles kept up the pace without flagging. Then they were allowed to ease down into a walk, until they got their wind again; and then started at the pace, half canter, half gallop, which is the usual rate of progression of the colonial horses. They drew rein at last on a slight eminence, from which the Donalds' station, a mile or so distant, could be perceived.  ""Thank God,"" Reuben muttered to himself, ""I am back here, at last. There is no occasion for further hurry;"" and the horses were allowed to go at an easy walk.  ""Man on horseback,"" Jim suddenly said, touching Reuben's arm.  ""Where--where, Jim?""  ""Gone from de house, sah, trough dem trees. Dare he go again, he gallop fast.""  Reuben had not caught sight of the figure, but he pressed his spurs against the horse's sides.  ""I will see who it is, at any rate. Jim, do you ride straight on to the house, and say I shall be there in a few minutes.""  As Reuben rode, at a headlong gallop, towards the point where his course would probably intersect that of the horseman, riding in the direction Jim had pointed out, he turned over rapidly, in his mind, the thought whether his anxiety for Kate Ellison was not making a fool of him. Why should he turn from his course, just at the end of a long journey, to start at full speed on the track of this figure, of which Jim had caught only a glance? It might be a stockman, or someone who had ridden over from one of the neighbouring stations to see how Donald was getting on; but even so, he told himself, no harm was done by his assuring himself of that.  It was not the way Mr. Barker would take to his station. Had it been a neighbour who had come over, he would not be likely to leave again, so early. Neither of the constables would be riding away, in defiance of his orders on no account to stir any distance from the house.  Presently he caught a glimpse of the horseman. He was not more than half a mile away now, but the view he obtained was so instantaneous that he could not distinguish any particulars.  ""He is riding fast, anyhow,"" he said. ""Faster than a man would travel, on ordinary business. He is either a messenger, sent on urgent business; or it is Thorne.""  He slightly altered the direction of his course, for the speed at which the horseman was travelling must take him ahead of him, at the point where Reuben had calculated upon cutting him off. In a short distance he would get a view of him; for the trees ended here, and the plain was open and unbroken, save by low bush.  When the figure came clear of the trees, he was but a quarter of a mile away; and Reuben gave a start, for he recognized at once the uniform of his own corps. It could only be one of the men left at Donald's and, with an exclamation of anger, Reuben pressed his horse to the utmost in pursuit of the man, who was now almost directly ahead, at the same time uttering a loud call.  The man glanced back but, to Reuben's surprise, instead of stopping waved his hand above his head, and pressed forward. Two miles were traversed before Reuben was beside him.  ""What do you mean, sir?"" he thundered out.  But the man pointed ahead.  ""He has carried off Miss Ellison, sir, and has shot Brown dead. I will tell you, afterwards.  ""There, do you see, sir, over that brow there?""  At the moment, Reuben saw a figure on horseback rise against the skyline, fully two miles in front.  ""Ride steadily, Smithson,"" he said. ""Keep me in view, and I will keep him. We must overtake him in time, for his horse is carrying double. I shall push on, for I am better mounted than you are; and he may try to double, and throw us off his traces. If anything happens to me don't stop for a moment, but hunt that fellow down to the end.""  Reuben had been holding his horse somewhat in hand, during the last mile, for he thought there must be some reason for the constable's strange conduct; but he now let him go and, urging him to his full speed, soon left the constable behind. He knew that, for some distance ahead, the country was flat and unbroken; and that the fugitive would have no chance of concealment, whichever way he turned.  Upon reaching the spot where he had seen the bush ranger pass, the wide plain opened before him; and he gave a shout of exultation, as he saw that he had gained considerably. The fugitive, indeed, had evidently not been pressing his horse.  ""He thinks he has a long journey before him,"" Reuben muttered. ""I fancy he's mistaken. He thinks he's only got a constable after him, and that he can easily rid himself of him, whenever he comes up to him. No doubt he learned from some of the convicts that everyone is away, and therefore thinks himself safe from all pursuit, when once he has wiped out Smithson. All the better. I shall overtake him all the sooner.""  Such indeed was the view of the bush ranger, who kept along at a steady canter, troubling himself very little about the solitary constable whom he believed to be in pursuit of him. When, indeed, on glancing round, he saw that his pursuer was within a quarter of a mile of him, he reined in his horse and, turning, calmly awaited his coming.  Reuben at once checked the speed of his horse. He knew that the man was said to be a deadly shot with his pistol, but he was confident in his own skill; for, with constant and assiduous practice, he had attained a marvellous proficiency with his weapon. But he did not care to give his foe the advantage, which a man sitting on a steady seat possesses, over one in the saddle of a galloping horse. He therefore advanced only at a walk.  The bush ranger put down the change in speed to fear, caused by his resolute attitude, and shouted:  ""Look here, constable. You had best turn your horse's head, and go home again. You know well enough that one constable is no match for me, so you had best rein up before I put a bullet in your head. If you shoot, you are just as likely to kill the young woman here, as you are me; and you know I don't make any mistake.""  Reuben was already conscious of his disadvantage in this respect, for the bush ranger held the girl on the saddle in front of him, so that her body completely covered his. She was enveloped in a shawl, which covered her head as well as her figure. Her captor held her tightly pressed to him with his left arm, while his right was free to use a pistol.  Reuben checked his horse at a distance of some fifty yards, while he thought over the best course to pursue. As he paused, Thorne, for the first time, noticed that it was an officer with whom he had to deal, and not with the constable; who, as he believed, was the only one in the district. He uttered a savage exclamation, for he felt that this materially altered the conditions of the affair.  ""Oh, it's you, is it?"" he said. ""I thought it was only one of your men; but the advice I gave is as good, for you, as for him. I advise you to turn back, before all my mates are down on you.""  ""Your mates will never be down on anyone again, Tom Thorne,"" Reuben said sternly. ""We have wiped out seven of them, and the other is a prisoner.""  ""It's a lie!"" the bush ranger said, furiously. ""They are two hundred miles away, in the bush.""  ""With your friend Bobitu, eh? Yes, they were, but they are not now, Thorne. They are lying under the ashes of that hut of yours, close to the tree where you buried your treasure; and it's I who am going to have help, not you. My man will be up in a few minutes,"" and he glanced round at the constable, whom the bush ranger now perceived, for the first time, less than half a mile away.  Reuben's words had the effect they were intended to excite. They filled the bush ranger with fury, and desire for vengeance; while the sight of the approaching constable showed him that, unless he took prompt measures, he would have two adversaries to fight at once.  Without a moment's hesitation, he set spurs to his horse and dashed at Reuben. When within twenty yards, he fired.  Reuben felt a sharp pain, as if a hot iron had been passed across his cheek. Thorne uttered a shout of exultation as he saw him start but, as he kept his seat, again raised his hand to fire. In an instant Reuben discharged his pistol, and the bush ranger's weapon dropped from his hand, for Reuben's bullet passed through his wrist.  Throwing the burden before him headlong to the ground, Thorne drew a pistol with his left hand; and the two shots rung out again, at almost the same instant. Reuben, however, was slightly the quickest, and this saved his life. His bullet passed through the bush ranger's body, while Thorne's pistol was diverted somewhat from its aim, and the bullet struck Reuben's left shoulder, instead of his head. In an instant, he had drawn another pistol.  ""Surrender or I fire!"" and then seeing, by the change in the bush ranger's face, and by his collapsing figure, that he was badly hit; he waited, still keeping Thorne covered with the muzzle, for the bush ranger had a charge left in the pistol which he still grasped in his left hand.  Twice Thorne tried to raise it, but in vain. Then he reeled in the saddle, the pistol dropped from his hand, and he fell heavily over on to the ground.  Reuben at once leaped from his horse, and ran to raise Kate Ellison; who lay motionless on the ground, as she had been thrown. Removing the shawl wrapped round her head, he found she was insensible. Kneeling beside her, he raised her head to his shoulder and, a minute later, the constable galloped up.  ""Badly hurt, captain?"" he asked, as he leaped off his horse; for the blood was streaming down Reuben's face, and his left arm hung useless.  ""Nothing to speak of, Smithson. See to Miss Ellison, first. There is some water in my flask in the holster. Just bring it here, and sprinkle her face. I hope she is only stunned; but that scoundrel threw her off with such force, that she may well be badly hurt.""  ""Is he done for, captain?"" the man asked, glancing at the prostrate figure of the bush ranger, as he proceeded to obey Reuben's instructions; ""because if you ain't certain about it, I had better put a bullet into him. These fellows are very fond of playing 'possum, and then turning the tables upon you.""  ""There is no fear of that, Smithson. He's hard hit. I hope he's not dead, for I would rather that he were tried for his crimes.""  It was some time before Kate Ellison opened her eyes. For a moment she looked vaguely round; then, as her eyes fell upon Reuben's face, she uttered a little cry, and raised herself into a sitting position.  ""What is it, Captain Whitney? Are you badly hurt?""  ""Thank God you have recovered, Miss Ellison. You began to frighten me horribly. I was afraid you were seriously injured.  ""Do not look so alarmed. I can assure you I am not much hurt; only a flesh wound, I fancy, in the cheek, and a broken collarbone.""  ""And you have saved me again, Captain Whitney?""  ""Yes, thank God I have had that good fortune,"" Reuben said quietly; ""and this time for good, for Tom Thorne will never molest you again.""  ""But can't I do something? Your face is bleeding dreadfully. Please let me bind it up;"" and tearing a strip off the bottom of her dress, she proceeded to bandage Reuben's face.  The constable took off the black silk handkerchief which he wore round his neck.  ""I think, miss, this will make a sling for his arm; and when that is done the captain will be pretty right.  ""Do you think you can ride back, sir?"" he asked, when he had fastened the handkerchief, ""or will you wait till I ride back to the farm, and fetch help.""  ""I can ride back well enough,"" Reuben said, trying to rise to his feet; but he found himself unable to do so.  The ball, after breaking his collarbone, had glanced downwards, and the wound was a more serious one than he had imagined.  ""No, I don't think I can ride back, Smithson.""  ""There is a light cart at the farm,"" Kate Ellison said. ""Please fetch that. I will stop here, with Captain Whitney, till you come back.""  ""I think that will be the best way, miss,"" the constable agreed and, mounting, he rode off at once.  It was an hour and a half before he returned, bringing the cart; but before he arrived, Mr. and Mrs. Barker had ridden up on horseback, the former having returned from his visit to the farm, just as the constable rode in. While they had been alone, Reuben had heard from Kate what had taken place.  ""I did as you told me, Captain Whitney, and did not go once outside the door. The constables kept a very sharp lookout, and one of them was always on guard by the door; so there really did not seem any possibility of danger.  ""This morning, as I was washing up the breakfast things with Mrs. Barker, a shot was suddenly fired outside the door and, before I had time to think what it meant, that man rushed in. He caught me by the wrist, and said:  ""'Come along, it's no use your screaming.'  ""Mrs. Barker caught up something and rushed at him, but he knocked her down with the butt end of his pistol. Then he caught up her shawl, which was lying on the chair close by, and threw it right over my head; and then caught me up, and carried me out.  ""I tried to struggle, but he seemed to hold me as if I were in a vice. I heard Alice scream, and then I must have fainted; for the next thing I knew was that I was being carried along on horseback. I was so muffled up, and he held me so tight, that I felt it was no use to struggle; and I made up my mind to lie quite still, as if I was still insensible, till he put me down; and then--I think I intended to try and seize his pistol, or to get hold of a knife, if there was one and, if I could not kill him, to kill myself.  ""There did not seem the least hope of rescue. Mr. Barker was away, and would not be back for hours. I supposed that the constables were shot, and all the men round were away with you; and from the distance you said you were going, I did not think you could be back for days.  ""Presently I felt him stop and turn his horse; and then, when he spoke, I knew that he had not killed both the constables, and that one of them had followed him. When you answered, I thought it was your voice, though it seemed impossible; but I could not be sure, because I could not hear plainly through the shawl. Then the pistols were fired, and I suddenly felt myself falling; and I did not know anything more, till I saw you leaning over me.  ""But where are all the others, and how is it you are here alone? Of course, you must have turned back before you got to where the bush rangers were.""  ""No, I am glad to say we succeeded with that part of the work, Miss Ellison, and have wiped out the bush rangers altogether. We have got one of them a prisoner, but all the rest of the gang are killed.  ""The distance is not quite so far as we thought it was. It was a thirty miles' march, and two sixties. We attacked them at daybreak, on the third day after leaving.""  ""But it is only the fourth day today, is it not? At least, it seems so to me.""  ""It is the fourth day, Miss Ellison. When we found that the leader of the gang was not with them, and I learned from the man we had taken prisoner that he had started to ride back here, twenty-four hours before, I was naturally very anxious about you; knowing, as I did, what desperate actions the man was capable of. So we started at once and, after a sharp fight with the blacks, got down in the evening to the water hole, sixty miles on our way back, where we had camped the second night out.  ""Of course the horse I had ridden could travel no further, but I pushed on with my black boy, on two of the horses which we had taken from the bush rangers, and which had been led so far. We made another forty miles by midnight, and then halted till daybreak, to give the horses rest; but they were so done up, this morning, that we could not get them much beyond a foot pace. When we came to the first settlement we exchanged them for fresh ones, and galloped on; and, thank God, we are just in time.""  The tears were standing in the girl's eyes, and she laid her hand on his, and said quietly:  ""Thank you. Then you have ridden a hundred and fifty miles since yesterday morning, besides having two fights; and all because you were uneasy about me?""  ""I had, as you see, good reason to be uneasy, Miss Ellison.""  At this moment a horse's hoofs were heard approaching, and Jim galloped up. He had, on arriving at the station, been unable to obtain any information as to what had taken place. Mrs. Donald was in a dead faint. Mrs. Barker had, just before he arrived, ridden off to meet her husband; but the dead body of the constable, by the door, and the disappearance of Kate, showed him what had taken place; and he at once started after his master.  His horse, however, was a very inferior one to that ridden by Reuben, and until he met the constable returning, he had been obliged to follow the track of the horses in front; so he did not arrive at the scene of the fray till half an hour after its conclusion. He uttered exclamations of dismay, at seeing his master's condition; for Reuben had been gradually growing faint, and could now scarcely support himself on his elbow.  Jim, however, had taken the precaution to snatch a bottle of spirits from the shelf, before he started; having an eye to his own comforts, as well as to the possibility of its being required. He now knocked off the neck, and poured some into the cup of Reuben's flask, and put it to his lips.  ""Thank you, Jim; that is just what I wanted.""  ""Massa lie down quiet,"" Jim said. ""No good sit up;"" and, gathering a large bunch of grass, he placed it under Reuben's head; and Reuben lay quiet, in a half dreamy state, until Mr. and Mrs. Barker rode up.  Kate rose to her feet as they approached; but she was so stiff and bruised, with her fall, that she could scarcely move forward to meet Mrs. Barker; and burst into tears, as her friend threw her arms round her.  ""That's right, my poor child,"" Mrs. Barker said. ""A cry will do you good. Thank God, my dear Kate, for your rescue.""  ""I do indeed, Mrs. Barker. It seems almost a miracle.""  ""Captain Whitney seems to spring out of the ground, whenever he's wanted. He seems hurt badly. The constable said it was a broken collarbone, but it must be something a good deal worse than that.""  ""Oh, don't say so, Mrs. Barker, after what he's done for me. If he were to die!""  ""There, there, don't tremble so, child. We must hope that it is not so bad as that; but he would hardly be looking so bad as he does, for only a broken collarbone. My husband broke his--one day the horse ran away with him, among some trees--and he was up and about again, in a day or two.  ""Is he badly hurt, do you think, John?"" she asked her husband, who was kneeling beside Reuben.  ""I hope not,"" the settler said. ""He ought not to be like this, only from a wound in the collarbone; but of course it may have glanced down, and done some internal mischief. I am inclined to think that it is extreme exhaustion, as much as anything--the reaction after a tremendous nervous excitement.""  ""He has ridden a hundred and fifty miles, since yesterday morning,"" Kate said, ""and has had two fights, besides this. Directly he knew that the leader of the bush rangers had escaped, he came on by himself.""  ""Oh! They caught the bush rangers, did they?"" Mr. Barker said, joyfully. ""I was afraid, by his getting back here so soon, that they must have missed them somehow, and found they were on the wrong scent.  ""And he has ridden all the way back, has he? A very zealous officer, Miss Ellison, a very zealous young officer, indeed.""  But Kate was too anxious, and shaken, to mark the significance of Mr. Barker's tone.  ""Don't tease her,"" his wife said, in a low voice. ""She is terribly upset and shaken, and can hardly stand.  ""Ah! What is that?""  The interruption was caused by a low groan from the fallen bush ranger.  ""Shoot him dead, sah,"" Jim, who was supporting his master's head, exclaimed. ""Don't let dat fellow come 'live no longer.""  ""I can't do that, Jim,"" Mr. Barker said, moving towards the fallen man. ""The man is a thorough scoundrel, a murderer, and a robber; but he is harmless now. One cannot wish he should recover, even for his own sake; for there is enough against him to hang him, ten times over. However, we must do what we can for the poor wretch.""  So saying, he mixed some brandy with a little water in the cup, and poured it between the bush ranger's lips.  ""Is it mortal?"" Mrs. Barker asked, as he rejoined her.  ""I think so,"" he said. ""I fancy he is shot through the lungs.  ""You must really sit down, Miss Ellison. You look as white as a ghost, and we cannot have you on our hands, just now. We have got them pretty full, as they are.  ""Ah! Here comes the cart.""  The constable had put a quantity of straw in the bottom of the light cart, and Barker and Jim raised Reuben, and laid him in it.  ""We must take the other, too,"" Mr. Barker said. ""The man is alive, and we can't leave him here.""  ""Yes,"" Kate said; ""he must go, too. He did Reuben a great wrong, years ago. I hope he will confess it, before he dies.""  Mr. Barker glanced at his wife, as Kate used the young officer's Christian name; but she was not thinking of Captain Whitney of the police, but of the boy Reuben, who had been accused of poisoning her father's dog, and of committing a burglary from his house.  ""You had better get up in front, with the constable, Miss Ellison,"" the settler said, when the two wounded men had been placed in the cart. ""You certainly are not fit to ride.  ""Or, look here, the constable shall take my horse, and I will drive; and then I can look after you, and you can use me for a prop, if you feel weak; but before we start, I must insist on your taking a sip of brandy and water.  ""It is no use your saying no,"" he persisted, as the girl shook her head. ""We shall have you fainting before you get home, if you don't.""  Kate did as she was ordered. Mr. Barker then helped her up to her seat. As she got up, her eyes fell upon Reuben's face.  ""Oh, Mr. Barker!"" she said. ""He looks dead. You are not deceiving me, are you?""  ""Bless me, no!"" the settler said, cheerfully. ""My opinion is that he's dead asleep. The loss of blood, the sudden reaction after the long excitement, and the exhaustion of his ride have completely overcome him; and my opinion is that he is sound asleep.  ""Jim, do you lead your master's horse, while the constable takes the other; and then you two had better ride on, and help Mrs. Donald get things ready. Get a bed up at once, for Captain Whitney; and get some clean straw in the outhouse, with one of the rugs over it, for the other.""  So saying, he touched the horse with the whip, and the cart moved slowly on, with Mrs. Barker riding beside it. She would have gone on ahead, to have assisted in the preparations; but she expected, momentarily, to see Kate faint, and thought it better to remain with her, in case her assistance should be required.  The journey occupied some time, for Mr. Barker picked the way carefully, so as not to jolt the cart. Mrs. Barker endeavoured to keep Kate's attention fixed, by asking her questions as to what she had heard about the expedition, wondering when it would return, and whether any of the settlers were hurt. When they got within half a mile of home, she said:  ""I think, dear, you are looking a little better now. I will ride on. Fortunately there is the beef tea we made, last night, for Mr. Donald. I will get it made hot, and I will get a cup of strong tea ready for you. That will do wonders.""  When the cart arrived Mrs. Donald ran out and, as Kate descended, clasped her in a long embrace.  ""Come straight in here, my dear,"" Mrs. Barker said. ""I have got a basin of cold water, and a cup of strong tea, and the two together will do marvels. We will attend to your wounded hero.""  Reuben remained perfectly quiet and inert, as he was lifted out and carried into the house, where a bed had been made up for him in a room on the ground floor.  ""Just lay him down. Throw a blanket over him, and let him lie perfectly quiet.""  ""Do you think he is really asleep?"" Mrs. Barker asked, as she looked at the quiet face.  ""I do, really,"" her husband replied. ""Put your ear close to his mouth. He is breathing as quietly as a child.  ""And,"" he added, placing his fingers on Reuben's wrist, ""his pulse is a little fast, but regular and quiet. Twenty-four hours of sleep will set him up again, unless I am greatly mistaken. I don't expect that his wound will turn out anything very serious.  ""Let me think. Was it not this afternoon that Ruskin said he would be back again?""  ""Yes, either yesterday or today.""  ""That is lucky. He will be surprised at finding two new patients on his hands, now.  ""I will go and have a look at that poor wretch in the shed. Give me a cupful of beef tea. I will pour a spoonful or two between his lips. You had better go and look after Kate. You will not be needed here, at present.  ""If your master wakes, Jim, let us know directly,"" he said to the black, who had seated himself on the ground by the side of Reuben's bed.  ""I can't call the poor fellow away from his master,"" he added to his wife, as he closed the door behind them; ""but I am really anxious to know what has taken place, out in the bush; and whether many of our fellows have been killed. If, as Kate said, she heard the captain tell the bush ranger that all his band had been killed, except one who is a prisoner, it has indeed been a most successful expedition; and we colonists can hardly be sufficiently grateful, to Whitney, for having rid us of these pests. What with that, and the thrashing the blacks have had, we shall be able to sleep quietly for months; which is more than we have done for a long time.""  Kate came out of the room, with Mrs. Donald, a minute later. The basin of cold water and the tea had had the effect Mrs. Barker predicted. A little colour had returned into her cheeks, and she looked altogether more like herself.  ""How is he?"" Mrs. Donald asked.  ""In my opinion, he's doing capitally, Mrs. Donald. His pulse is quiet and even, and he's breathing as quietly as a child; and I believe he is simply in a state of exhaustion, from which he is not likely to wake till tomorrow morning; and I predict that, in a few days, he will be up and about. Indeed, if that bullet hasn't misbehaved itself, I see no reason why he shouldn't be up tomorrow.""  ""That is indeed a relief, to us both,"" Mrs. Donald said, while Kate could only clasp her hands in silent thankfulness.  ""And now, how is your husband? I hope he is none the worse, for all this exertion.""  ""He was terribly agitated, at first,"" Mrs. Donald said. ""I fainted, you know, and he got out of bed to help me up; and it was as much as I could do, when I recovered, to get him to lie down; for he wanted to mount and ride after Kate, although, of course, he is as weak as a child, and even with my help he could scarcely get into bed again.  ""Fortunately Mrs. Barker ran in, before she started on horseback to fetch you, to say that the constable was off in pursuit, and that quieted him. Then I think he was occupied in trying to cheer me, for as soon as he was in bed I broke down and cried; till the constable came back to say that Captain Whitney had overtaken, and shot, the bush ranger.""  Three hours later, to the great relief of all, the surgeon arrived. He was first taken in to look at Reuben, having been told all the circumstances of the case; and he confirmed Mr. Barker's opinion that he was really in a deep sleep.  ""I would not wake him, on any account,"" he said. ""It is a great effort of nature, and he will, I hope, awake quite himself. Of course, I can't say anything about the wound, till he does.  ""Now for his antagonist.""  The bush ranger was still unconscious, though occasionally broken words came from his lips. The surgeon examined his wound.  ""He is shot through the lungs,"" he said, ""and is bleeding internally. I do not think that there is the shadow of a chance for him, and no one can wish it otherwise. It will only save the colony the expense of his trial.  ""And now for my original patient.""  He was some time in Mr. Donald's room and, when he came out, proceeded at once to mix him a soothing draught, from the case of medicines he carried behind the saddle.  ""We must get him off to sleep, if we can,"" he said; ""or we shall have him in a high state of fever, before morning. A man in his state can't go through such excitement as he has done, without paying the penalty.  ""And now, I suppose, I have done,"" he said with a smile, as Mrs. Donald left the room with the medicine.  ""Yes, I think so,"" Mrs. Barker said. ""If you had come an hour earlier, I should have put this young lady under your charge; but I think that the assurance of my husband, that Captain Whitney was doing well, has been a better medicine than you could give her.""  ""No wonder she is shaken,"" Mr. Ruskin remarked.  ""Mrs. Barker tells me you had a heavy fall, too, Miss Ellison.""  ""Yes,"" she replied. ""I was stunned for a time but, beyond being stiff and bruised, I am none the worse for it.""  ""Look here, Miss Ellison,"" the doctor said, after putting his fingers on her wrist, ""I suppose you will want to be about, tomorrow, when our brave army returns. Now, there is nothing you can do here. Mrs. Donald can nurse her husband. The other two require no nursing. Mrs. Barker, I am sure, will take charge of the house; and therefore, seriously, I would ask you to take this draught I am about to mix for you, and to go upstairs and go to bed, and sleep till morning.""  ""I could not sleep,"" Kate protested.  ""Very well, then, lie quiet without sleeping; and if, in the evening, you find you are restless, you can come down for an hour or two; but I really must insist on your lying down for a bit.  ""Now, Mrs. Barker, will you take this medicine up, and put this young lady to bed.""  ""I hope she will get off to sleep,"" Mrs. Barker said, when she came downstairs again.  ""I have no doubt whatever about it,"" Mr. Ruskin replied. ""I have given her a very strong sleeping draught, far stronger than I should think of giving, at any other time; but after the tension that the poor girl must have gone through, it would need a strong dose to take effect. I think you will hear nothing more of her, till the morning.""  Indeed, it was not until the sun was well up, the next morning, that Kate Ellison woke. She could hardly believe that she had slept all night; but the eastern sun, coming in through her window, showed her that she had done so. She still felt bruised and shaken all over, but was otherwise herself again. She dressed hastily, and went downstairs.  ""That's right, my dear,"" Mrs. Barker, who was already busy in the kitchen, said. ""You look bonny, and like yourself.""  ""How are my brother and Captain Whitney?"" Kate asked.  ""I don't think Mr. Donald is awake, yet,"" Mrs. Barker replied; ""but Captain Whitney has just gone out to the shed, with my husband and the surgeon.""  ""Gone out to the shed!"" Kate repeated, in astonishment.  ""Yes, my dear. That poor wretch out there is going fast. He recovered consciousness about two hours ago. The constable was sitting up with him. He asked for water, and then lay for some time, quite quiet.  ""Then he said, 'Am I dreaming, or was it Reuben Whitney I fought with?'  ""'Yes, it was Captain Reuben Whitney, our inspector,' the constable replied.  ""For a time he lay quiet again, and then said: 'I want to see him.'  ""The constable told him he was asleep, and couldn't be woke.  ""'Is he badly wounded?' the man asked. 'I know I hit him.'  ""'Not very badly, I hope,' the constable answered.  ""'When he wakes ask him to come to me,' the man said. 'I know I am dying, but I want to see him first. If he can't come, let somebody else come.'  ""The constable came in and roused the doctor, who went out and saw him, and said he might live three or four hours yet.  ""Soon afterwards, just as the sun rose, Jim came out, to say that his master was awake. Mr. Ruskin went in to him and examined his wound, and probed the course of the bullet. It had lodged down just at the bottom of the shoulder bone. I am glad to say he was able to get it out. When he had done, he told his patient what the bush ranger had said; and Captain Whitney insisted upon going out to him.""  ""It won't do him any harm, will it?"" Kate asked anxiously.  ""No, my dear, or Mr. Ruskin would not have let him go. I saw him as he went out, and shook hands with him and, except that nasty bandage over his face, he looked quite himself again. As I told you, a broken collarbone is a mere nothing and, now we know where the bullet went and have got it out, there is no occasion for the slightest anxiety.  ""Here they come again, so you can judge for yourself.""  A very few words passed between Reuben and Kate; for Mrs. Barker, who saw how nervous the girl was, at once began to ask him questions about what the bush ranger had said.  ""He has made a confession, Mrs. Barker, which your husband has written down, and Mr. Ruskin and Smithson have signed. It is about a very old story, in which I was concerned when a boy; but it is a great gratification for me to have it cleared up, at last. I was accused of poisoning a dog, belonging to Miss Ellison's father; and was tried for a burglary, committed on the premises, and was acquitted, thanks only to Miss Ellison's influence, exerted on my behalf--  ""I fear,"" he said with a slight smile, ""somewhat illegally.  ""However, the imputation would have rested on me all my life, if it had not been for Thorne's confession. I thought that he did the first affair. I knew that he was concerned in the second, although I could not prove it; but he has now made a full confession, saying that he himself poisoned the dog, and confirming the story I told at the trial.""  ""Oh, I am glad!"" Kate exclaimed. ""You know, Captain Whitney, that I was sure of your innocence; but I know how you must have longed for it to be proved to the world.  ""What will you do, Mr. Barker, to make it public?""  ""I shall send a copy of the confession, properly attested, to the magistrates of Lewes; and another copy to the paper which, Captain Whitney tells me, is published there weekly.  ""It is curious,"" he went on, ""that the sight of Whitney should have recalled those past recollections; while, so far as I could see, everything that has happened afterwards, his career of crime and the blood that he has shed, seem altogether forgotten.""  ""I suppose there is no hope for him?"" Kate asked, in a low voice.  ""He is dying now,"" Mr. Barker said. ""Ruskin is with him. He was fast becoming unconscious when we left him, and Ruskin said that the end was at hand.""  A quarter of an hour later the surgeon came in, with the news that all was over.  ""Now, Captain Whitney, you must come into your room, and let me bandage up your shoulder properly. I hadn't half time to do it, before.""  ""But you won't want me to lie in bed, or any nonsense of that sort?"" Reuben asked.  ""I would, if I thought you would obey my orders; but as I see no chance of that, I shall not trouble to give them. Seriously, I do not think there is any necessity for it, providing always that you will keep yourself very quiet. I shall bandage your arm across your chest, so there can be no movement of the shoulder; and when that is done, I think you will be all right.""  There was only one more question which Reuben had to ask, with regard to the event of the preceding day--why it was that Smithson did not go to his comrade's assistance. He then learned that Thorne rode quietly up to the back of the house and dismounted, then went to the stable, where Smithson was asleep--having been on guard during the night--and pushed a piece of wood under the latch of the door, so that it could not be raised. Having thus securely fastened Smithson in, he had gone to the front of the house, and had apparently shot down the constable there before the latter was aware of his presence.  Smithson, awakened by the shot, tried in vain to get out; and was only released by Mrs. Barker, when she recovered from the effect of the stunning blow which the bush ranger had struck her. He had then mounted at once, and followed in pursuit.  In the afternoon the party returned from the bush, having experienced no further molestation from the natives. Nothing occurred to interfere with the progress of Reuben's wound and, in the course of a fortnight, he was again able to resume his duties.  The complete destruction of the gang of bush rangers, and the energy with which they had been pursued into the very heart of the bush country, made a vast sensation in the colony; and Reuben gained great credit, and instant promotion for his conduct.  A month after the return of the party from the bush, Mr. Donald was about again and, as the danger was now past, he abandoned his idea of selling his property. The course which events took can be judged by the following conversation, between Mrs. Donald and her sister, three months later.  ""Well, Kate, after all he has done for us, of course I have nothing to say against it; and I don't suppose you would mind, if I had. Still, I do think you might have done better.""  ""I could not have done better,"" Kate said hotly, ""not if I had had the pick of the whole colony.""  ""Well, not in one way, my dear; for you know that, personally, I like him almost as well as you do. Still, I do think it is a little unfortunate that we ever knew him before.""  ""And I think it's extremely fortunate,"" Kate said stoutly. ""If it hadn't been that he had known us before, and cared for me--he says worshipped, but that's nonsense--ever since I was a child, he would never have made that terrible ride, and I--""  ""Oh, don't talk about it, Kate; it's too dreadful even to think of now.  ""Well, my dear, no doubt it's all for the best,"" Alice said philosophically. ""At any rate, you are quite happy, and he is a noble fellow. But I hope, for your sake, that he won't stay in the police. It would be dreadful for you when he was riding about, hunting after bush rangers and blacks; for you know, my dear, there are plenty of others left in the colony.""  ""I told him so yesterday,"" Kate said shyly. ""I said, of course, that I didn't want to influence him.""  Alice broke into a laugh.  ""You little goose, as if what you say doesn't influence him.""  Three weeks later, Reuben received a letter from Mr. Hudson.  ""My dear Whitney, I am glad to hear, from you, that you are engaged to be married; and the circumstances which you tell me of make it a most interesting affair. If I were you, I should cut the constabulary. I enclose a paper from Wilson, giving you three weeks' leave. Come down to Sydney at once, and talk it over with me. You know I regard you as my son, and I am going to have a voice in the matter.""  Reuben went down to Sydney and, after ascertaining his views, Mr. Hudson went into town and forthwith arranged for the purchase, for him, of a partnership in the chief engineering firm in the town. When he told Captain Wilson what he had done, the latter declared that he had robbed the colony of its best police officer. Reuben protested against the generosity of the old settler, but the latter declared he would have no nonsense on the subject.  ""I am one of the richest men in the colony,"" he said, ""and it's hard if I can't spend my money as I choose.""  There is little more to tell. Reuben became one of the leading citizens of Sydney and, twenty years afterwards, sold his business and returned to England, and bought an estate not far from Lewes, where he is still living with his wife and family. He was accompanied from Australia by his mother; who, in spite of her strong objections to the sea, went out to live with him, two years after his marriage.  The only point upon which Reuben Whitney and his wife have never been able to come to an absolute agreement is as to which owes most to the other.
